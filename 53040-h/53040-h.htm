<p class="dropcap">Rogers, the book-keeper for the
past twenty-two years of my
friend Patterson, the banker, told
me the other day that he had
reared a family of two boys and
three girls on his annual salary of two thousand
two hundred dollars; that he had put one of the
boys through college, one through the School of
Mines, brought up one of the girls to be a librarian,
given one a coming-out party and a trousseau,
and that the remaining daughter, a home
body, was likely to be the domestic sunshine of
his own and his wife’s old age. All this on two
thousand two hundred dollars a year.</p>

<p>Rogers told me with perfect modesty, with just
a tremor of self-satisfaction in his tone, as though,
all things considered, he felt that he had managed
creditably, yet not in the least suggesting
that he regarded his performance as out of the
common run of happy household annals. He is
a neat-looking, respectable, quiet, conservative
little man, rising fifty, who, while in the bank,
invariably wears a nankeen jacket all the year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
round, a narrow black necktie in winter, and a
narrow yellow and red pongee wash tie in summer,
and whose watch is no less invariably right
to a second. As I often drop in to see Patterson,
his employer, I depend upon it to keep mine
straight, and it was while I was setting my chronometer
the other day that he made me the foregoing
confidence.</p>

<p>Frankly, I felt as though I had been struck
with a club. It happened to be the first of the
month. Every visit of the postman had brought
me a fresh batch of bills, each one of which was
a little larger than I had expected. I was correspondingly
depressed and remorseful, and had
been asking myself from time to time during
the day why it need cost so much to live. Yet
here was a man who was able to give his daughter
a coming-out party and a trousseau on two
thousand two hundred dollars a year. I opened
my mouth twice to ask him how in the name of
thrift he had managed to do it, but somehow the
discrepancy between his expenditures and mine
seemed such a gulf that I was tongue-tied. “I
suppose,” he added modestly, “that I have been
very fortunate in my little family. It must indeed
be sharper than a serpent’s tooth to have a thankless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
child.” Gratitude too! Gratitude and Shakespeare
on two thousand two hundred dollars a
year. I went my way without a word.</p>

<p>There are various ways of treating remorse.
Some take a Turkish bath or a pill. Others, while
the day lasts, trample it under foot, and shut it
out at night with the bed-clothes. Neither course
has ever seemed to me exactly satisfactory or
manly. Consequently I am apt to entertain my
self-reproach and reason with it, and when one
begins to wonder why it costs so much to live,
he finds himself grappling with the entire problem
of civilization, and presently his hydra has
a hundred heads. The first of the month is apt
to be a sorry day for my wife as well as for me,
and I hastened on my return home to tell her,
with just a shadow of reproach in my tone, what
Mr. Rogers had confided to me. Indeed I saw
fit to ask, “Why can’t we do the same?”</p>

<p>“We could,” said Barbara.</p>

<p>“Then why don’t we?”</p>

<p>“Because you wouldn’t.”</p>

<p>I had been reflecting in the brief interval between
my wife’s first and second replies that, in
the happy event of our imitating Rogers’s example
from this time forth and forever more, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
should be able to lay up over five thousand dollars
a year, and that five thousand dollars a year
saved for ten years would be fifty thousand dollars&mdash;a
very neat little financial nest egg. But
Barbara’s second reply upset my calculation utterly,
and threw the responsibility of failure on
me into the bargain.</p>

<p>“Mr. Rogers is the salt of the earth, a highly
respectable man and, if I am not mistaken, the
deacon of a church,” I remarked not altogether
relevantly. “Why should we spend four times
as many thousand dollars a year as he?”</p>

<p>“I wonder,” answered my wife, “if you really
do appreciate how your friend Mr. Rogers lives.
I am quite aware that you are talking now for
effect&mdash;talking through your hat as the children
say&mdash;because it’s the first of the month and
you’re annoyed that the bills are worse than
ever, and I understand that you don’t for one
moment seriously entertain the hope that our
establishment can be conducted on the same
basis as his. But I should just like to explain to
you for once how people who have only twenty-two
hundred dollars a year and are the salt of
the earth do live, if only to convince you that
the sooner we stop comparing ourselves with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
them the better. I say ‘we’ because in my moments
of depression over the household expenses
I catch myself doing the same thing. Our
butcher’s bill for this month is huge, and when
you came in I was in the throes of despair over
a letter in the newspaper from a woman who contends
that a good housekeeper in modest circumstances
can provide an excellent dinner for her
family of six persons, including soup, fish, an
entrée, meat, pudding, dessert, and coffee, for
fifty-three cents. And she gives the dinner, which
at first sight takes one’s breath away. But after
you prune it of celery, parsley, salted peanuts,
raisins, red cabbage, salad, and cheese, all there is
left is bean-soup, cod sounds, fried liver, hot gingerbread,
and apples.”</p>

<p>“I should dine down town, if you set such
repasts before me,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Barbara. “And there is a very
good point of departure for illustrating the domestic
economies of the Rogers family. Mr. Rogers
does dine down town. Not to avoid the fried
liver and cod sounds, for probably he is partial to
them, but because it is cheaper. When you take
what you call your luncheon, and which is apt to
include as much as he eats in the entire course of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the day, Mr. Rogers dines; dines at a restaurant
where he can get a modest meal for from fifteen
to twenty-five cents. Sometimes it is pea-soup
and a piece of squash-pie. The next day perhaps
a mutton-stew and a slice of watermelon, or boiled
beef and an éclair. Mrs. Rogers and the children
have a pick-up dinner at home, which lasts them
very well until night, when they and Rogers sit
down to browned-hash mutton and a head of
lettuce, or honey-comb tripe and corn-cake, and
apple-sauce to wind up with.”</p>

<p>“That isn’t so very bad.”</p>

<p>“Why, they have a splendid time. They can
abuse their social acquaintance and discuss family
secrets without fear of being overheard by the
servants because they don’t keep any servants to
speak of. Probably they keep one girl. Or perhaps
Mr. Rogers had a spinster sister who helped
with the work for her board. Or it may be Mrs.
Rogers kept one while the children were little;
but after the daughters were old enough to do it
themselves, they preferred not to keep anybody.
They live extremely happily, but the children
have to double up, for in their small house it is
necessary to sleep two in a room if not a bed.
The girls make most of their dresses, and the boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
never dream of buying anything but ready-made
clothing. By living in the suburbs they let one
establishment serve for all seasons, unless it be
for the two weeks when Rogers gets his vacation.
Then, if nobody has been ill during the year, the
family purse may stand the drain of a stay at the
humblest watering-place in their vicinity, or a
visit to the farm-house of some relative in the
country. An engagement with the dentist is a
serious disaster, and the plumber is kept at a respectable
distance. The children go to the public
schools, and the only club or organization to
which Mr. Rogers belongs is a benefit association,
which pays him so much a week if he is ill,
and would present his family with a few hundred
dollars if he were to die. The son who went
through college must have got a scholarship or
taken pupils. The girl who married undoubtedly
made the greater portion of her trousseau with
her own needle; and as to the coming-out party,
some of the effects of splendor and all the delights
of social intercourse can be produced by
laying a white drugget on the parlor carpet, the
judicious use of half a dozen lemons and a mould
of ice-cream with angel-cake, and by imposing on
the good nature of a friend who can play the piano<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
for dancing. There, my dear, if you are willing
to live like that, we should be able to get
along on from twenty-two to twenty-five hundred
dollars quite nicely.”</p>

<p>My wife was perfectly correct in her declaration
that I did not seriously entertain the hope of
being able to imitate Mr. Rogers, worthy citizen
and upright man as I believe him to be. I certainly
was in some measure talking through my
hat. This was not the first time I had brought
home a Rogers to confront her. She is used to
them and aware that they are chiefly bogies. I, as
she knows, and indeed both of us, are never in
quite a normal condition on the first day of the
month, and are liable, sometimes the one of us
and sometimes the other, to indulge in vagaries
and resolutions which by the tenth, when the
bills are paid, seem almost uncalled for or impracticable.
One thing is certain, that if a man
earns only twenty-two hundred dollars a year,
and is an honest man withal, he has to live on it,
even though he dines when others take luncheon,
and is forced to avoid the dentist and the plumber.
But a much more serious problem confronts
the man who earns four times as much as Rogers,
more serious because it involves an alternative.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Rogers could not very well live on less if he
tried, without feeling the stress of poverty. He
has lived at hard pan, so to speak. But I could.
Could if I would, as my wife has demonstrated.
I am perfectly right, as she would agree, in being
unwilling to try the experiment; and yet the consciousness
that we spend a very large sum of
money every year, as compared with Rogers and
others like him, remains with us even after the
bills are paid and we have exchanged remorse
for contemplation.</p>

<p>The moralist, who properly is always with us,
would here insinuate, perhaps, that Rogers is happier
than I. But I take issue with him promptly
and deny the impeachment. Rogers may be happier
than his employer Patterson, because Patterson,
though the possessor of a steam-yacht, has
a son who has just been through the Keeley cure
and a daughter who is living apart from her husband.
But there are no such flies in my pot of
ointment. I deny the superior happiness of Rogers
in entire consciousness of the moral beauty of his
home. I recognize him to be an industrious, self-sacrificing,
kind-hearted, sagacious husband and
father, and I admit that the pen-picture which
the moralist could draw of him sitting by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
evening lamp in his well-worn dressing gown,
with his well-darned feet adorned by carpet-slippers
of filial manufacture supported by the table
or a chair, would be justly entitled to kindle emotions
of respect and admiration. But why, after
all, should Rogers, ensconced in the family sitting-room
with the cat on the hearth, a canary
twittering in a cage and scattering seed in one
corner, a sewing-machine in the other, and surrounded
by all the comforts of home, consisting
prominently of a peach-blow vase, a Japanese
sun umbrella and engravings of George Washington
and Horace Greeley, be regarded as happier
than I in my modern drawing-room in evening
dress? What is there moral in the simplicity
of his frayed and somewhat ugly establishment
except the spirit of contentment and the gentle
feelings which sanctify it? Assuming that these
are not lacking in my home, and I believe they
are not, I see no reason for accepting the conclusion
of the moralist. There is a beauty of living
which the man with a small income is not apt
to compass under present social conditions, the
Declaration of Independence to the contrary notwithstanding.
The doctrine so widely and vehemently
promulgated in America that a Spartan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
inelegance of life is the duty of a leading citizen,
seems to be dying from inanition; and the descendants
of favorite sons who once triumphed
by preaching and practising it are now outvying
those whom they were taught to stigmatize as
the effete civilizations of Europe, in their devotion
to creature comforts.</p>

<p>It seems to me true that in our day and generation
the desire to live wisely here has eclipsed
the desire to live safely hereafter. Moreover, to
enjoy the earth and the fulness thereof, if it be
legitimately within one’s reach, has come to be
recognized all the world over, with a special point
of view for each nationality, as a cardinal principle
of living wisely. We have been the last to recognize
it here for the reason that a contrary theory
of life was for several generations regarded as one
of the bulwarks of our Constitution. Never was
the sympathy for the poor man greater than it
is at present. Never was there warmer interest
in his condition. The social atmosphere is rife
with theories and schemes for his emancipation,
and the best brains of civilization are at work in
his behalf. But no one wishes to be like him.
Canting churchmen still gain some credence by
the assertion that indigence here will prove a saving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
grace in the world to come; but the American
people, quick, when it recognizes that it has been
fooled, to discard even a once sacred conviction,
smiles to-day at the assumption that the owner
of a log cabin is more inherently virtuous than
the owner of a steam-yacht. Indeed the present
signal vice of democracy seems to be the fury to
grow rich, in the mad struggle to accomplish
which character and happiness are too often sacrificed.
But it may be safely said that, granting
an equal amount of virtue to Rogers and to me,
and that each pays his bills promptly, I am a
more enviable individual in the public eye.</p>

<p>In fact the pressing problem which confronts
the civilized world to-day is the choice of what
to have, for so many things have become necessaries
of existence which were either done without
or undiscovered in the days of our grandmothers,
that only the really opulent can have
everything. We sometimes hear it said that this
or that person has too much for his own good.
The saying is familiar, and doubtless it is true
that luxury unappreciated and abused will cause
degeneration; but the complaint seems to me to
be a Sunday-school consoler for those who have
too little rather than a sound argument against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
great possessions. Granting that this or that person
referred to had the moral fibre of Rogers or
of me, and were altogether an unexceptionable
character, how could he have too much for his
own good? Is the best any too good for any one
of us?</p>

<p>The sad part of it is, however, that even those
of us who have four times, or thereabouts, the
income of Rogers, are obliged to pick and choose
and cannot have everything. Then is the opportunity
for wisdom to step in and make her abode
with us, if she only will. The perplexity, the distress,
and too often the downfall of those who
would fain live wisely, are largely the direct results
of foolish or unintelligent selection on their
part. And conversely, is not the secret of happy
modern living, the art of knowing what to have
when one cannot have everything there is?</p>

<p>I coupled just now, in allusion to Rogers and
myself, virtue and punctuality in the payment of
bills, as though they were not altogether homogeneous.
I did so designedly, not because I question
that prompt payment is in the abstract a
leading virtue, nor because I doubt that it has
been absolutely imperative for Rogers, and one
of the secrets of his happiness; but because I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
am not entirely sure whether, after ten years of
prompt payment on the first of every month on
my part, I have not been made the sorry victim
of my own righteousness, self-righteousness I
might say, for I have plumed myself on it when
comparing myself with the ungodly. Although
virtuous action looks for no reward, the man who
pays his bills as soon as they are presented has
the right to expect that he will not be obliged to
pay anything extra for his honesty. He may not
hope for a discount, but he does hope and believe&mdash;at
least for a time&mdash;that beefsteak paid
for within thirty days of purchase will not be
taxed with the delinquencies of those who pay
tardily or not at all. Slowly but sadly I and my
wife have come to the conclusion that the butchers,
bakers, and candlestick-makers of this great
Republic who provide for the tolerably well-to-do
make up their losses by assessing virtue. It
is a melancholy conclusion for one who has been
taught to believe that punctual payment is the
first great cardinal principle of wise living, and
it leaves one in rather a wobbly state of mind,
not as regards the rank of the virtue in question,
but as regards the desirability of strictly living
up to it in practice. I have heard stated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
authority that the leading butchers, grocers, stable-keepers,
drygoods dealers, dress-makers,
florists, and plumbers of our great cities divide
the customers on their books into sheep and
goats, so to speak; and the more prompt and
willing a sheep, the deeper do they plunge the
knife. Let one establish a reputation for prompt
payment and make a purchase on the twenty-fifth
of the month, he will receive on the first of the
following a bill, on the twentieth, if this be not
paid, a bill for “account rendered,” on the first
of the next month a bill for “account rendered,
please remit,” and on the tenth a visit from a collector.
On the other hand I have known people
who seem to live on the fat of the land, and to
keep the tradesfolk in obsequious awe of them
by force of letting their bills run indefinitely.</p>

<p>Abroad, as many of us know, the status of the
matter is very different. There interest is figured
in advance, and those who pay promptly
get a handsome discount on the face of their bills.
While this custom may seem to encourage debt,
it is at least a mutual arrangement, and seems to
have proved satisfactory, to judge from the fact
that the fashionable tailors and dress-makers of
London and Paris are apt to demur or shrug<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
their shoulders at immediate payment, and to be
rather embarrassingly grateful if their accounts
are settled by the end of a year. No one would
wish to change the national inclination of upright
people on this side of the water to pay on the
spot, but the master and mistress of an establishment
may well consider whether the fashionable
tradesmen ought to oblige them to bear the entire
penalty of being sheep instead of goats. With
this qualification, which is set forth rather as a
caveat than a doctrine, the prompt payment of
one’s bills seems to be strictly co-ordinate with
virtue, and may be properly described as the
corner-stone of wise modern living.</p>

<p>There are so many things which one has to
have nowadays in order to be comfortable that
it seems almost improvident to inquire how much
one ought to save before facing the question of
what one can possibly do without. Here the people
who are said to have too much for their own
good have an advantage over the rest of us. The
future of their children is secure. If they dread
death it is not because they fear to leave their
wives and children unprovided for. Many of
them go on saving, just the same, and talk poor
if a railroad lowers a dividend, or there is not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
ready market for their real estate at an exalted
profit. Are there more irritating men or women
in the world than the over-conservative persons
of large means who are perpetually harping on
saving, and worrying lest they may not be able
to put by for a rainy day, as they call it, twenty-five
per cent. or more of their annual income?
The capitalist, careworn by solicitude of this sort,
is the one fool in creation who is not entitled to
some morsel of pity.</p>

<p>How much ought the rest of us to save? I
know a man&mdash;now you do not know him, and
there is no use in racking your brains to discover
who he is, which seems to be a principal motive
for reading books nowadays, as though we
writers had a cabinet photograph in our mind’s
eye whenever we took a pen in hand. I know a
man who divides his income into parts. “All
Gaul is divided into three parts,” you will remember
we read in the classics. Well, my friend,
whom we will call Julius Cæsar for convenience
and mystification, divides his income, on the
first of January, into a certain number of parts
or portions. He and his wife have a very absorbing
and earnest pow-wow over it annually. They
take the matter very seriously, and burn the midnight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
oil in the sober endeavor to map and figure
out in advance a wise and unselfish exhibit.
So much and no more for rent, so much for servants,
so much for household supplies, so much
for clothes, so much for amusements, so much for
charity, so much to meet unlooked-for contingencies,
and so much for investment. By the time
the exhibit is finished it is mathematically and
ethically irreproachable, and, what is more, Julius
Cæsar and his wife live up to it so faithfully
that they are sure to have some eight or ten dollars
to the good on the morning of December
thirty-first, which they commonly expend in a
pair of canvas-back ducks and a bottle of champagne,
for which they pay cash, in reward for
their own virtue and to enable them at the stroke
of midnight to submit to their own consciences
a trial balance accurate to a cent.</p>

<p>Now it should be stated that Mr. and Mrs.
Julius Cæsar are not very busy people in other
respects, and that their annual income, which is
fifteen thousand dollars, and chiefly rent from
improved real estate in the hands of a trustee,
flows on as regularly and surely as a river.
Wherefore it might perhaps be argued, if one
were disposed to be sardonic, that this arithmetical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
system of life under the circumstances
savors of a fad, and that Julius and his wife take
themselves and their occupation a trifle too seriously,
especially as they have both been known
to inform, solemnly and augustly, more than
one acquaintance who was struggling for a living,
that it is every one’s duty to lay up at least
one-tenth of his income and give at least another
tenth in charity. And yet, when one has ceased
to smile at the antics of this pair, the consciousness
remains that they are right in their practice
of foresight and arithmetical apportioning, and
that one who would live wisely should, if possible,
decide in advance how much he intends to
give to the poor or put into the bank. Otherwise
he is morally, or rather immorally, certain
to spend everything, and to suffer disagreeable
qualms instead of enjoying canvas-back ducks
and a bottle of champagne on December thirty-first.</p>

<p>As to what that much or little to be given
and to be saved shall be, there is more room for
discussion. Julius Cæsar and his wife have declared
in favor of a tenth for each, which in
their case means fifteen hundred dollars given,
and fifteen hundred dollars saved, which leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
them a net income of twelve thousand dollars
to spend, and they have no children. I am inclined
to think that if every man with ten thousand
dollars a year and a family were to give
away three hundred dollars, and prudently invest
seven hundred dollars, charity would not
suffer so long as at present, and would be no
less kind. Unquestionably those of us who come
out on December thirty-first just even, or eight
or nine dollars behind instead of ahead, and
would have been able to spend a thousand or
two more, are the ones who find charity and saving
so difficult. Our friends who are said to have
too much for their own good help to found a
hospital or send a deserving youth through
college without winking. It costs them merely
the trouble of signing a check. But it behooves
those who have only four instead of forty times
as much as Rogers, if they wish to do their share
in relieving the needs of others, to do so promptly
and systematically before the fine edge of the
good resolutions formed on the first of January
is dulled by the pressure of a steadily depleted
bank account, and a steadily increasing array of
bills. Charity, indeed, is more difficult for us to
practise than saving, for the simplest method of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
saving, life insurance, is enforced by the “stand
and deliver” argument of an annual premium.
Only he, who before the first crocus thrusts its
gentle head above the winter’s snow has sent his
check to the needy, and who can conscientiously
hang upon his office door “Fully insured; life
insurance agents need not apply,” is in a position
to face with a calm mind the fall of the leaf
and the December days when conscience, quickened
by the dying year, inquires what we have
done for our neighbor, and how the wife and the
little ones would fare if we should be cut down
in the strength of our manhood.</p>

<p>And yet, too, important as saving is, there
are so many things which we must have for the
sake of this same wife and the little ones that
we cannot afford to save too much. Are we to
toil and moil all our days, go without fresh butter
and never take six weeks in Europe or Japan
because we wish to make sure that our sons and
daughters will be amply provided for, as the
obituary notices put it? Some men with daughters
only have a craze of saving so that this one
earthly life becomes a rasping, worrying ordeal,
which is only too apt to find an end in the
coolness of a premature grave. My friend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Perkins&mdash;here is another chance, identity seekers,
to wonder who Perkins really is&mdash;the father of
four girls, is a thin, nervous lawyer, who ought
to take a proper vacation every summer; but
he rarely does, and the reason seems to be that
he is saddled by the idea that to bring a girl up
in luxury and leave her with anything less than
five thousand dollars a year is a piece of paternal
brutality. It seems to me that a father ought
in the first place to remember that some girls
marry. I reminded Perkins of this one day.
“Some don’t,” he answered mournfully. “Marriage
does not run in the female Perkins line. The
chances are that two of my four will never marry.
They might be able to get along, if they lived together
and were careful, on seven thousand dollars
a year, and I must leave them that somehow.”
“Hoot toot,” said I, “that seems to me
nonsense. Don’t let the spectre of decayed gentlewomen
hound you into dyspepsia or Bright’s
disease, but give yourself a chance and trust to
your girls to look out for themselves. There are
so many things for women to do now besides
marry or pot jam, that a fond father ought to let
his nervous system recuperate now and then.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you mean that they might become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
teachers or physicians or hospital nurses or typewriters,”
said Perkins. “Declined with thanks.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think,” I inquired with a little
irritation, “that they would be happier so than
in doing nothing on a fixed income, in simply
being mildly cultivated and philanthropic on
dividends, in moving to the sea-side in summer
and back again in the autumn, and in dying at
the last of some fashionable ailment?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” said Perkins. “Do you?”</p>

<p>Were I to repeat my answer to this inquiry I
should be inviting a discussion on woman, which
is not in place at this stage of our reflections.
Let me say, though, that I am still of the opinion
that Perkins ought to give his nervous system
a chance and not worry so much about his
daughters.</p>

<p class="dropcap">Seeing that there are so many
things to have and that we cannot
have everything, what are we to
choose? I have sometimes, while
trudging along in the sleighing season, noticed
that many men, whose income I believe to be
much smaller than mine, were able to ride behind
fast trotters in fur overcoats. The reason
upon reflection was obvious to me. Men of a
certain class regard a diamond pin, a fur overcoat,
and a fast horse as the first necessaries of
existence after a bed, a hair-brush and one maid-of-all-work.
In other words, they are willing to
live in an inexpensive locality, with no regard
to plumbing, society, or art, to have their food
dropped upon the table, and to let their wives
and daughters live with shopping as the one
bright spot in the month’s horizon, if only they,
the husbands and fathers, can satisfy the three-headed
ruling ambition in question. The men
to whom I am referring have not the moral or
æsthetic tone of Rogers and myself, and belong
to quite a distinct class of society from either of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
us. But among the friends of both of us there
are people who act on precisely the same principle.
A fine sense of selection ought to govern
the expenditure of income, and the wise man
will refrain from buying a steam-yacht for himself
or a diamond crescent for his wife before he
has secured a home with modern conveniences,
an efficient staff of servants, a carefully chosen
family physician, a summer home, or an ample
margin wherewith to hire one, the best educational
advantages for his children which the community
will afford, and choice social surroundings.
In order to have these comfortably and
completely, and still not to be within sailing distance,
so to speak, of a steam-yacht, one needs
to have nowadays&mdash;certainly in large cities&mdash;an
income of from seven thousand to eleven
thousand dollars, according to where one lives.</p>

<p>I make this assertion in the face of the fact that
our legislators all over the country annually
decree that from four to five thousand dollars a
year is a fat salary in reward for public service,
and that an official with a family who is given
twenty-five hundred or three thousand is to be
envied. Envied by whom, pray? By the ploughman,
the horse-car conductor, and the corner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
grocery man, may be, but not by the average
business or professional man who is doing well.
To be sure, five thousand dollars in a country
town <em>is</em> affluence, if the beneficiary is content to
stay there; but in a city the family man with
only that income, provided he is ambitious, can
only just live, and might fairly be described as
the cousin german to a mendicant. And yet there
are some worthy citizens still, who doubtless
would be aghast at these statements, and would
wish to know how one is to spend five thousand
dollars a year without extravagance. We certainly
did start in this country on a very different basis,
and the doctrine of plain living was written
between the lines of the Constitution. We were
practically to do our own work, to be content
with pie and doughnuts as the staple articles of
nutrition, to abide in one locality all the year
round, and to eschew color, ornament, and refined
recreation. All this as an improvement over the
civilization of Europe and a rebuke to it. Whatever
the ethical value of this theory of existence
in moulding the national character may have
been, it has lost its hold to-day, and we as a
nation have fallen into line with the once sneered-at
older civilizations, though we honestly believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
that we are giving and going to give a peculiar
redeeming brand to the adopted, venerable customs
which will purge them of dross and bale.</p>

<p>Take the servant question, for instance. We
are perpetually discussing how we are to do away
with the social reproach which keeps native
American women out of domestic service; yet
at the same time in actual practice the demand
for servants grows more and more urgent and
wide-spread, and they are consigned still more
hopelessly, though kindly, to the kitchen and
servants’ hall in imitation of English upper-class
life. In the days when our Emerson sought to
practise the social equality for which he yearned,
by requiring his maids to sit at his own dinner-table,
a domestic establishment was a modest affair
of a cook and a second girl. Now, the people
who are said to have too much for their own
good, keep butlers, ladies’ maids, governesses,
who like Mahomet’s coffin hover between the
parlor and the kitchen, superfine laundresses,
pages in buttons, and other housekeeping accessories,
and domestic life grows bravely more
and more complex. To be sure, too, I am quite
aware that, as society is at present constituted,
only a comparatively small number out of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
millions of free-born American citizens have or
are able to earn the seven to eleven thousand dollars
a year requisite for thorough comfort, and
that the most interesting and serious problem
which confronts human society to-day is the annihilation
or lessening of the terrible existing inequalities
in estate and welfare.</p>

<p>This problem, absorbing as it is, can scarcely
be solved in our time. But, whatever the solution,
whether by socialism, government control,
or brotherly love, is it not safe to assume that
when every one shares alike, society is not going
to be satisfied with humble, paltry, or ugly conditions
as the universal weal? If the new dispensation
does not provide a style and manner of
living at least equal in comfort, luxury, and refinement
to that which exists among the well-to-do
to-day, it will be a failure. Humanity will
never consent to be shut off from the best in
order to be exempt from the worst. The millennium
must supply not merely bread and butter, a
house, a pig, a cow, and a sewing-machine for
every one, but attractive homes, gardens, and
galleries, literature and music, and all the range
of æsthetic social adjuncts which tend to promote
healthy bodies, delightful manners, fine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
sensibilities, and noble purposes, or it will be no
millennium.</p>

<p>Therefore one who would live wisely and has
the present means, though he may deplore existing
misery and seek to relieve it, does not give
away to others all his substance but spends it
chiefly on himself and his family until he has satisfied
certain needs. By way of a house he feels
that he requires not merely a frail, unornamental
shelter, but a carefully constructed, well ventilated,
cosily and artistically furnished dwelling,
where his family will neither be scrimped for
space nor exposed to discomforts, and where he
can entertain his friends tastefully if not with elegance.
All this costs money and involves large
and recurrent outlays for heating, lighting, upholstery,
sanitary appliances, silver, china, and
glass. It is not sufficient for him that his children
should be sure of their own father; he is
solicitous, besides, that they should grow up as
free as possible from physical blemishes, and
mentally and spiritually sound and attractive.
To promote this he must needs consult or engage
from time to time skilled specialists, dentists,
oculists, dancing and drawing masters, private
tutors, and music-teachers. To enable these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
same sons and daughters to make the most of
themselves, he must, during their early manhood
and womanhood, enable them to pursue
professional or other studies, to travel, and to
mingle in cultivated and well-bred society. He
must live in a choice neighborhood that he may
surround himself and his family with refining
influences, and accordingly he must pay from
twelve hundred to twenty-five hundred or three
thousand dollars a year for rent, according to the
size and desirability of the premises. Unless he
would have his wife and daughters merely household
factors and drudges, he must keep from
three to five or six servants, whose wages vary
from four to six or seven dollars a week, and
feed them.</p>

<p>Nor can the athletic, æsthetic, or merely pleasurable
needs of a growing or adolescent household
be ignored. He must meet the steady and
relentless drain from each of these sources, or be
conscious that his flesh and blood have not the
same advantages and opportunities which are enjoyed
by their contemporaries. He must own a
pew, a library share, a fancy dress costume, and
a cemetery lot, and he must always have loose
change on hand for the hotel waiter and the colored<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
railway porter. The family man in a large
city who meets these several demands to his
entire satisfaction will have little of ten thousand
dollars left for the purchase of a trotter, a fur
overcoat, and a diamond pin.</p>

<p>The growing consciousness of the value of
these complex demands of our modern civilization,
when intelligently gratified, acts at the present
day as a cogent incentive to make money, not
for the mere sake of accumulation, but to spend.
Gross accumulation with scant expenditure has
always been sanctioned here; but to grow rich
and yet be lavish has only within a comparatively
recent period among us seemed reconcilable
with religious or national principles. Even
yet he who many times a millionaire still walks
unkempt, or merely plain and honest, has not entirely
lost the halo of hero worship. But, though
the old man is permitted to do as he prefers, better
things are demanded of his sons and daughters.
Nor can the argument that some of the
greatest men in our history have been nurtured
and brought up in cabins and away from refining
influences be soundly used against the advisability
of making the most of income, even
though we now and then ask ourselves whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
modern living is producing statesmen of equally
firm mould. But we thrill no longer at mention
of a log cabin or rail splitting, and the very name
of hard cider suggests rather unpleasantly the
corner grocery store and the pie-permeated, hair-cloth
suited New England parlor.</p>

<p>Merely because other nations have long been
aware that it was wise and not immoral to try
to live comfortably and beautifully our change
of faith is no less absorbing to us. We confidently
expect to win fresh laurels by our originality,
intelligence, and unselfishness in this new
old field. Already have we made such strides
that our establishments on this side of the water
make up in genuine comfort what they lack in
ancient manorial picturesqueness and ghost-haunted
grace. Each one of us who is in earnest
is asking how he is to make the most of what he
has or earns, so as to attain that charm of refined
living which is civilization’s best flower&mdash;living
which if merely material and unanimated by intelligence
and noble aims is without charm, but
which is made vastly more difficult of realization
in case we are without means or refuse to spend
them adequately.</p>

<h2>The <i>Dwelling</i>.</h2>

<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-m.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Mr. and Mrs. Julius Cæsar, who,
as you may remember, divide
their income into parts with
mathematical precision, were not
as well off in this world’s goods
at the time of their marriage as they are now.
Neither Mr. Cæsar’s father nor Mrs. Cæsar’s
grandmother was then dead, and consequently
the newly wedded pair, though set up by their
respective families with a comfortable income,
felt that it was incumbent upon them to practise
strict economy. Then it was that Julius conceived
what seemed to them both the happy
idea of buying a house dirt cheap in a neighborhood
which was not yet improved, and improving
the neighborhood, instead of paying an
exorbitant price for a residence in a street which
was already all it should be.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Julius, “shouldn’t we buy one of
those new houses in Sunset Terrace? They look
very attractive, and if we can only induce two or
three congenial couples to join forces with us we
shall have the nucleus of a delightful colony.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>“Besides, everything will be nice and new,”
said Mrs. Julius, or Dolly Cæsar, as her friends
know her. “No cockroaches, no mice, no moths,
no family skeletons to torment us. Julius, you are
a genius. We can just as well set the fashion as
follow meekly in fashion’s wake.”</p>

<p>So said, so done. Julius Cæsar bent his intellect
upon the matter and soon found three congenial
couples who were willing to join forces with him.
Before another twelve months had passed, four
baby-wagons&mdash;one of them double-seated&mdash;were
to be seen on four sunny grass-plots in
front of four attractive, artistic-looking villas on
Sunset Terrace. Where lately sterility, mortar,
and weeds had held carnival, there was now an
air of tasteful gentility. Thanks to the example
of Dolly Cæsar, who had an eye and an instinct
for such matters, the four brass door-plates
shone like the sun, the paint was spick and
span, the four gravel paths were in apple-pie
order, the four grass-plots were emerald from
timely use of a revolving lawn sprinkler, and
the four nurse-maids, who watched like dragons
over the four baby-wagons, were neat-looking
and comely. No wonder that by the end of the
second year there was not a vacant house in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the street, and that everybody who wished to
live in a fashionable locality was eager for a
chance to enter Sunset Terrace. No wonder, too,
that Mr. and Mrs. Julius Cæsar were able, by
the end of the fourth year, to emerge from Sunset
Terrace with a profit on the sale of their
villa which made it rent free for the entire period,
and left them with a neat little surplus to
boot, and to settle down with calm minds on
really fashionable Belport Avenue, in the stately
mansion devised to them by Mrs. Cæsar’s grandmother.</p>

<p>Now, it must be borne in mind that a Mr.
and Mrs. Julius Cæsar can sometimes do that
which a Mr. and Mrs. George J. Spriggs find
difficulty in accomplishing. Spriggs, at the time
of his marriage to Miss Florence Green, the
daughter of ex-Assistant Postmaster-General
Homer W. Green, conceived the happy idea of
setting up his household gods in Locust Road,
which lies about as far from Belport Avenue in
one direction as Sunset Terrace in the other.
Both are semi-suburban. It also occurred to him
at the outset to join forces with three or four
congenial couples, but at the last moment the
engagement of one of the couples in question<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
was broken, and the other three decided to live
somewhere else. To have changed his mind then
would have involved the sacrifice of one hundred
dollars paid to bind the bargain to the landowner.
So it seemed best to them on the whole
to move in, as they had to live somewhere.</p>

<p>“It’s just a little bit dreary, isn’t it?” said
Florence Spriggs, pathetically, as she looked out
of her bow window at the newly finished street
which was not finished, and at the grass-plot
where there was no grass. “But I sha’n’t be a
bit lonely with you, George.”</p>

<p>“I wonder if the color of this house has been
changed,” said Spriggs, presently, as he glanced
up at the façade and from that to the other houses
in the block, each of which was vacant. He and
Florence had gone out after dinner to take a
stroll and survey the neighborhood which they
hoped to improve.</p>

<p>“Of course it hasn’t! How could it be?”
said Florence.</p>

<p>“Somehow it looks a more staring shade of
yellow than it did the first time we saw it. And
I don’t fancy altogether the filigree work on the
door, or that Egyptian renaissance scroll set into
the eastern wall, do you, dearest? However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
we’re in now and can’t get out, for the title has
passed. I wonder who will buy the other
houses?”</p>

<p>They were soon to know. They were alone
all winter, but in the early spring a family moved
in on either side of them. The houses in Locust
Road, like those in Sunset Terrace, were of the
villa order, with grass-plots, which were almost
lawns, appurtenant. Though less pleasing than
those which had taken the more discerning eye
of Mrs. Julius Cæsar, they were nevertheless
comparatively inoffensive and sufficiently tasteful.
Neighbor number one proved to be of an
enterprising and imaginative turn. He changed
the color of his villa from staring yellow to startling
crushed strawberry, supplemented his Egyptian
renaissance scroll and filigree with inlaid
jewel and frost work, stationed a cast-iron stag
in one corner of the grass-plot and a cast-iron
Diana with a bow in another, and then rested on
his laurels. Neighbor number two was shiftless
and untidy. His grass-plot did not thrive, and
the autumn leaves choked his gravel path. His
windows were never washed, his blinds hung
askew, and his one maid-of-all-work preferred
the lawn to the laundry as a drying-room. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
wife sunned herself in a wrapper, and he himself
in his shirt sleeves. A big mongrel dog drooled
perpetually on the piazza or tracked it with his
muddy feet, and even the baby-wagon wore the
appearance of dilapidation and halted because of
a broken spring.</p>

<p>The Spriggses tried to be lenient and even
genial with both these neighbors, but somehow
the attempt was not successful. Neighbor number
one became huffy because Spriggs took no
notice of his advice that he embellish his grass-plot
with a stone mastiff or an umbrella and
cherub fountain, and neighbor number two took
offence because Spriggs complained that the ventilator
on his chimney kept Mrs. Spriggs awake
by squeaking. Mrs. Spriggs did her best to set
them both a good example by having everything
as tasteful on the one hand and as tidy on the
other as it should be. In the hope of improving
them she even dropped suggestive hints as to
how people ought to live, but the hints were not
taken. What was worse none of the other houses
were taken. As Spriggs pathetically expressed it,
the iron stag on the one side and the weekly
wash on the other kept purchasers at bay. He
tried to buoy himself up by believing that a glut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
in the real estate market was the cause why the
remaining villas in Locust Road hung fire, but
this consolation was taken away from him the
following spring when an active buying movement
all along the line still left them without
other neighbors. The unoccupied villas had begun
to wear an air of dilapidation, in spite of
their Egyptian renaissance scrolls and the presence
of a cast-iron Diana.</p>

<p>To crown the situation the baby of neighbor
number two caught diphtheria from being left in
its halting wagon by the maid-of-all-work too
near the cesspool on the lawn, and was kissed
by the Spriggs baby before the fact was discovered.
If there is one thing more irritating to the
maternal mind than another, it is to have dear
baby catch something from the child of people
whom you reprobate. One feels that the original
horrors of the disease are sure to be enhanced
through such a medium. When the only child
of the Julius Cæsars died of the same disease,
contracted from a germ inhaled on Belport Avenue,
the parents felt that only destiny was to
blame. On the other hand, though the Spriggs
baby recovered, Mrs. Spriggs never quite forgave
herself for what had happened. Before the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
autumn Spriggs parted with his estate on Locust
Road for so much less than he had paid for
it that he felt obliged to accept the hospitality
of his wife’s father, ex-Assistant Postmaster-General
Green, during the succeeding winter.</p>

<p>The moral of this double-jointed tale is twofold;
firstly that the young householder cannot
always count upon improving the neighborhood
in which he sets up his goods and chattels after
marriage, and secondly, that, in case the neighborhood
fails to improve, a tenancy for a year
or two is a less serious burden than absolute
ownership. It is extremely pleasant, to be sure,
to be able to declare that one has paid for one’s
house, and I am aware that the consciousness
of unencumbered ownership in the roof over
one’s head affords one of the most affecting and
effective opportunities for oratory which the free-born
citizen can desire. The hand of many a husband
and father has been stayed from the wine-cup
or the gaming-table by the pathetic thought
that he owned his house. As a rule, too, it is
cheaper to pay the interest on a mortgage than
to pay rent, and if one is perfectly sure of being
able to improve the neighborhood, or at least save
it from degeneration, it certainly seems desirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
to be the landlord of one’s house, even though it
be mortgaged so cleverly that the equity of redemption
is merely a name. But in this age of
semi-suburban development, when Roads and
Terraces and Parks and Gates and other Anglo-European
substitutes for streets serve as “springes
to catch woodcocks,” a young couple on real
estate ownership bent should have the discerning
eye of a Mrs. Julius Cæsar in order not to fall
a prey to the specious land and lot speculator.
If you happen to hit on a Sunset Terrace, everything
is rose color, but to find one’s self an
owner in fee on a Locust Road, next door to
crushed strawberry and a cast-iron stag, will palsy
the hopes of the hopeful.</p>

<p>What attractive, roomy, tasteful affairs many
of these semi-suburban villas, which are built
nowadays on the new Roads, Terraces, Parks,
Gates, and even Streets, are to be sure. There
are plenty of homely ones too, but it is a simple
matter to avoid the Egyptian renaissance scroll,
and the inlaid jewel work and stained-glass bull’s
eyes if one only will. They seem to be affording
to many a happy solution of the ever new and
ever old problem, which presents itself to every
man who is about to take a wife, whether it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
preferable to live in the city or the country.
These new suburbs, or rather outlying wards of
our large cities, which have been carved out of
what, not many years ago, was real country where
cows browsed and woods flourished, must be very
alluring to people who would fain live out of
town and still be in it. When, by stepping on
an electric car or taking the train, you can, within
a quarter of an hour, be on your own piazza inhaling
fresh air and privileged to feast your eyes
on a half acre or less of greensward belonging to
yourself, there would seem to be strong inducements
for refusing to settle down in a stuffy,
smoky, dusty, wire-pestered city street, however
fashionable. Rapid transit has made or is making
the environs of our cities so accessible that
the time-honored problem presents itself under
different conditions than formerly. There is no
such thing now as the real country for anybody
who is not prepared to spend an hour in the train.
Even then one is liable to encounter asphalt walks
and a Soldier’s monument in the course of a sylvan
stroll. But the intervening territory is ample
and alluring.</p>

<p>For one-half the rent demanded for a town
house of meagre dimensions in the middle of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
block, with no outlook whatever, new, spacious,
airy, ornamental homes with a plot of land and a
pleasing view attached, are to be had for the seeking
within easy living distance from nearly every
large city. When I begin to rhapsodize, as I
sometimes do, I am apt to ask myself why it is
that anybody continues to live in town. It was
only the other day that I happened, while driving
with my wife in the suburbs, to call her attention,
enthusiastically, to the new house which Perkins
has secured for himself. You may remember that
Perkins is the thin, nervous lawyer with four
daughters, who is solicitous as to what will become
of them when he is dead. We drove by
just as he came up the avenue from the station,
which is only a three minutes’ walk from the
house. He looked tired&mdash;he always does&mdash;but
there was already a fresh jauntiness in his tread
as though he sniffed ozone. He looked up at the
new house complacently, as well he might, for it
is large enough even for four daughters, and has
all the engaging impressiveness of a not too
quaintly proportioned and not too abnormally
stained modern villa, a highly evolved composite
of an old colonial mansion, a Queen Anne cottage,
and a French château. Before he reached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
the front door, two of his daughters ran out to
embrace him and relieve him of his bag and bundles,
and a half-hour later, as we drove back, he
was playing lawn tennis with three of his girls,
in a white blazer with pink stripes and knickerbockers,
which gave his thin and eminently respectable
figure a rather rakish air.</p>

<p>“Barbara,” I said to my wife, “why isn’t Perkins
doing the sensible thing? That’s a charming
house, double the size he could get for the same
money in town&mdash;and the rent is eight hundred
or a thousand dollars instead of fifteen hundred
or two thousand. He needs fewer servants out
here, for the parlor-maid isn’t kept on tenterhooks
to answer the door-bell, and there is fresh
air to come back to at night, and the means for
outdoor exercise on his own or his neighbor’s
lawn, which for a nervous, thin-chested, sedentary
man like Perkins is better than cod-liver
oil. Think what robust specimens those daughters
should be with such opportunities for tennis,
golf, skating, and bicycling.</p>

<p>“On Sundays and holidays, if the spirit moves
him and his wife and the girls to start off on an
exploring expedition, they are not obliged to take
a train or pound over dusty pavements before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
they begin; the wild flowers and autumn foliage
and chestnut-burs are all to be had in the woods
and glens within a mile or two of their own home.
Or if he needs to be undisturbed, no noise, no
interruption, but nine hours’ sleep and an atmosphere
suited to rest and contemplation on his
piazza or by his cheerful, tasteful fireside. Why
isn’t this preferable to the artificial, restless life
of the city?”</p>

<p>“And yet,” said Barbara, “I have heard you
state that only a rich man can afford to live in
the country.”</p>

<p>Women certainly delight to store up remarks
made in quite another connection, and use them
as random arguments against us.</p>

<p>“My dear Barbara,” said I, “this is not the
country. Of course in the real country, one needs
so many things to be comfortable nowadays&mdash;a
large house, stables, horses, and what not&mdash;it has
always seemed to me that a poor man with social
or cultivated instincts had better stay in town.
But have not Perkins and these other semi-suburbanites
hit the happy medium? They have
railroads or electric cars at their doors, and yet
they can get real barn-yard smells.”</p>

<p>“I doubt if they can,” said Barbara. “That is,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
unless they start a barn-yard for the purpose, and
that would bring the health authorities down upon
them at once. If this <em>were</em> the country, I could
entirely thrill at the description you have just
given of your friend Mr. Perkins. The real country
is divine; but this is oleomargarine country.
On the other hand, however, I quite agree with
you that if Mr. Perkins is delicate, this is a far
healthier place for him than the city, in spite of
the journey in the train twice a day. The houses&mdash;his
house in particular&mdash;are lovely, and I dare
say we all ought to do the same. He can certainly
come in contact with nature&mdash;such nature as
there is left within walking distance&mdash;easier than
city people. But to console me for not having one
of these new, roomy villas, and to prevent you
from doing anything rash, I may as well state a
few objections to your paradise. As to expense,
of course there is a saving in rent, and it is true
that the parlor-maid does not have to answer the
door-bell so often, and accordingly can do other
things instead. Consequently, too, Mrs. Perkins
and the four girls may get into the habit of going
about untidy and in their old clothes. A dowdy
girl with rosy cheeks and a fine constitution is a
pitiable object in this age of feminine progress.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Mr. Perkins will have to look out for this, and
he may require cod-liver oil after all.</p>

<p>“Then there is the question of schools. In
many of these semi-suburban paradises there are
no desirable schools, especially for girls, which
necessitates perpetual coming and going on trains
and cars, and will make education a wearisome
thing, especially for Mrs. Perkins. She will find,
too, that her servants are not so partial to wild
flowers and chestnut-burs and fresh air as her
husband and daughters. Only the inexperienced
will apply, and they will come to her reluctantly,
and as soon as she has accustomed them to her
ways and made them skilful, they will tell her
they are not happy, and need the society of their
friends in town.</p>

<p>“Those are a few of the drawbacks to the
semi-suburban villa; but the crucial and most serious
objection is, that unless one is very watchful,
and often in spite of watchfulness, the semi-suburbanite
shuts himself off from the best social
interests and advantages. He begins by imagining
that there will be no difference; that he will
see just as much of his friends and go just as frequently
to balls and dinner-parties, the concert
and the theatre, the educational or philanthropic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
meeting. But just that requisite and impending
twenty minutes in the train or electric car at the
fag end of the day is liable to make a hermit of
him to all intents and purposes by the end of the
second year. Of course, if one is rich and has one’s
own carriage, the process of growing rusty is more
gradual, though none the less sure. On that very
account most people with a large income come to
town for a few months in winter at any rate. There
are so many things in life to do, that even friends
with the best and most loving intentions call once
on those who retire to suburban villas and let
that do for all time. To be sure, some people
revel in being hermits and think social entertainments
and excitements a mere waste of time
and energy. I am merely suggesting that for
those who wish to keep in close touch with the
active human interests of the day, the semi-suburban
villa is somewhat of a snare. The Perkinses
will have to exercise eternal vigilance, or they will
find themselves seven evenings out of seven nodding
by their fireside after an ample meal, with
all their social instincts relaxed.”</p>

<p>Undeniably Barbara offered the best solution
of this question in her remark, that those who
can afford it spend the spring and autumn in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
country and come to town for the winter months.
Certainly, if I were one of the persons who are
said to have too much for their own good, I
should do something of the kind. I might not
buy a suburban villa; indeed, I would rather go
to the real country, where there are lowing kine,
and rich cream and genuine barn-yard smells, instead
of electric cars and soldiers’ monuments.
There would I remain until it was time to kill
the Thanksgiving turkey, and then I would hie
me to town in order to refresh my mental faculties
with city sights and sounds during the
winter-spring solstice, when the lowing kine are
all in the barn, and even one who owns a suburban
villa has to fight his way from his front
door through snow-drifts, and listen to the whistling
wind instead of the robin red-breast or
tinkling brook.</p>

<p>Patterson, the banker, is surely to be envied
in his enjoyment of two establishments, notwithstanding
that the double ownership suggests
again the effete civilizations of Europe, and was
once considered undemocratic. Patterson, though
his son has been through the Keeley cure, and
his daughter lives apart from her husband, has
a charming place thirty-five miles from town,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
where he has many acres and many horses, cows,
and sheep, an expanse of woods, a running stream,
delicious vegetables and fruit; golf links, and a
fine country house with all the modern improvements,
including a cosy, spacious library. Then
he has another house&mdash;almost a palace&mdash;in
town which he opens in the late autumn and occupies
until the middle of May, for Patterson, in
spite of some foibles, is no tax dodger.</p>

<p>Yes, to have two houses and live half of the
year in town and the other half in the country,
with six to eight weeks at the sea-side or mountains,
so as to give the children salt air and bathing,
or a thorough change, is what most of us
would choose in case we were blessed with too
much for our own good. But, unfortunately or
fortunately, most of us with even comfortable
incomes cannot have two houses, and consequently
must choose between town and country
or semi-country, especially as the six or eight
weeks at the sea-side or mountains is apt to seem
imperative when midsummer comes. According,
therefore, as we select to live in one or the other,
it behooves us to practise eternal vigilance, so
that we may not lose our love of nature and
wreck our nerves in the worldly bustle of city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
life, or become inert, rusty, and narrow among
the lowing kine or in semi-suburban seclusion.
In order to live wisely, we who dwell in the
cities should in our spare hours seek fresh air,
sunlight, and intercourse with nature, and we
whose homes are out of town should in our turn
rehabilitate our social instincts and rub up our
manners.</p>

<p>Regarding the real country, there is one other
consideration of which I am constantly reminded
by a little water-color hanging in my library,
painted by me a few years ago while I was staying
with my friend Henley. It represents a
modest but pretty house and a charming rustic
landscape. I call it Henley’s Folly. Henley, who
possessed ardent social instincts, had always lived
in town; but he suddenly took it into his head
to move thirty miles into the country. He told
me that he did so primarily for the benefit of
his wife and children, but added that it would
be the best thing in the world for him, that it
would domesticate him still more completely,
and give him time to read and cultivate himself.
When I went to stay with him six months later,
he was jubilant regarding the delights of the
country, and declared that he had become a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
genuine farmer. He pished at the suggestion
that the daily journey to and from town was exhausting,
and informed me that his one idea was
to get away from the bricks and mortar as early
in the afternoon as possible. Just two years later
I heard with surprise, one day, that the Henleys
had sold their farm and were coming back to
town. The reason&mdash;confided to me by one of the
family&mdash;was that his wife was so much alone that
she could not endure the solitude any longer.
“You see,” said my informant, “the nearest
house of their friends was four miles off, and as
Henley stayed in town until the last gun fired, the
days he returned home at all, and as he had or invented
a reason for staying in town all night at
least once a week, poor Mrs. Henley realized
that the lot of a farmer’s wife was not all roses
and sunshine.” From this I opine that if one
with ardent social instincts would live wisely he
should not become a gentleman farmer merely
for the sake of his wife and children.</p>

<h2>The <i>Dwelling</i>.</h2>

<h3>II.</h3>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-w-1.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">Whether we live in the city or the
country, it must be apparent to all of
us that a great wave of architectural
activity in respect to dwelling-houses
has been spreading over our land during the past
twenty years. The American architect has been
getting in his work and showing what he could
do, with the result that the long, monotonous row
of brick or freestone custom-made city houses,
and the stereotyped white country farm-house
with green blinds and an ell or lean-to attached,
have given place to a vivid and heterogeneous
display of individual effort. Much of this is fine
and some deadly, for the display includes not
merely the generally tasteful and artistic conceptions
of our trained native architects, who
have studied in Paris, but the raw notions of
all the builders of custom-made houses who,
recognizing the public desire for striking and
original effects, are bent upon surpassing one
another.</p>

<p>Therefore, while we have many examples, both
urban and suburban, of beautiful and impressive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
house architecture, the new sections of our cities
and suburbs fairly bristle with a multiplicity of
individual experiments in which the salient features
of every known type of architecture are
blended fearlessly together. The native architect
who has neither been to Paris nor been able
to devote much time to study has not been limited
in the expression of his genius by artistic
codes or conventions. Consequently he has felt
no hesitation in using extinguisher towers, mediæval
walls, battlement effects, Queen Anne cottage
lines, Old Colonial proportions, and Eastern
imagery in the same design, and any one of them
at any critical juncture when his work has seemed
to him not sufficiently striking for his own or the
owner’s taste.</p>

<p>Satisfactory as all this is as evidence of a progressive
spirit, and admitting that many of even
these lawless manifestations of talent are not without
merit, it is nevertheless aggressively true that
the smug complacency of the proprietor of the
suburban villa, which is hedged about by a stone
rampart of variegated rough stone on an ordinary
building lot, has no justification whatever.
Nor has the master of the castellated, gloomy,
half-Moorish, half-mediæval mansion, which disfigures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the fashionable quarter of many of our
cities, occasion to congratulate himself on having
paid for a thing of beauty. The number of our
well-trained architects, though constantly increasing,
is still small, especially as compared with the
number of people of means who are eager to
occupy a thing of beauty; then, too, even the
trained architect is apt to try experiments for the
sake of testing his genius, on a dog, so to speak&mdash;some
confiding plutocrat with a love of splendor
who has left everything to him.</p>

<p>The result is that grotesque and eye-distressing
monsters of masonry stand side by side on
many of our chief avenues with the most graceful
and finished specimens of native architectural
inspiration. As there is no law which prevents
one from building or buying an ugly house, and
as the architect, whose experiment on a dog tortures
the public eye, suffers no penalty for his
crime, our national house architecture may be
said to be working out its own salvation at the
public expense. It is the duty of a patriotic citizen
to believe that in this, as in other matters of
national welfare, the beautiful gradually will prevail;
and assuredly the many very attractive private
residences which one sees both in the city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
and the country should tend to make us hopeful.</p>

<p>Why is it that the rich man who would live
wisely feels the necessity for so large a house in
the city? Almost the first thing that one who has
accumulated or inherited great possessions does
nowadays is to leave the house where very likely
he has been comfortable and move into a mammoth
establishment suggesting rather a palace or
an emporium than a house. Why is this? Some
one answers that it is for the sake of abundant
light and extra space. Surely in a handsome house
of twenty-five or thirty feet front there should be
light and space enough for the average family,
however fastidious or exacting. In the country,
where one needs many spare rooms for the accommodation
of guests, there are some advantages
in the possession of an abnormally large
house. But how is the comfort of the city man
enhanced by one, that is, if the attendant discomforts
are weighed in the same scale? It has
sometimes seemed to me that the wealthy or successful
man invests in a prodigious mansion as
a sort of testimonial; as though he felt it incumbent
on him to erect a conventional monument
to his own grandeur or success, in order to let
the public entertain no doubt about it. But so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
many otherwise sensible men have deliberately
built huge city houses that this can scarcely be
the controlling motive in all cases. Perhaps, if
asked, they would throw the responsibility on
their wives. But it is even more difficult to understand
why a sensible woman should wish one
of the vast houses which our rising architects are
naturally eager to receive orders to construct. A
handsome house where she can entertain attractively,
yes: an exquisitely furnished, sunny, corner
house by all means; a house where each child
may have a room apart and where there are plenty
of spare rooms, if you like; but why a mammoth
cave? She is the person who will suffer the discomforts
to be weighed in the same scale, for the
care will fall on her.</p>

<p>We have in this country neither trained servants
nor the housekeeper system. The wife and
mother who is the mistress of a huge establishment
wishes it to be no less a home than her
former residence, and her husband would be the
first to demur were she to cast upon others the
burdens of immediate supervision. A moderate-sized
modern house is the cause of care enough,
as we all know, and wherefore should any woman
seek to multiply her domestic worries by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
duplicating or trebling the number of her servants?
To become the manager of a hotel or to
cater for an ocean steamship is perhaps a tempting
ambition for one in search of fortune, but
why should a woman, who can choose what she
will have, elect to be the slave of a modern palace
with extinguisher towers? Merely to be able
to invite all her social acquaintance to her house
once a year without crowding them? It would
be simpler to hire one of the many halls now
adapted for the purpose.</p>

<p>The difficulty of obtaining efficient servants,
and the worries consequent upon their inefficiency,
is probably the chief cause of the rapid
growth of the apartment-house among us. The
contemporary architect has selected this class of
building for some of his deadliest conceits. Great
piles of fantastically disposed stone and iron
tower up stories upon stories high, and frown
upon us at the street-corners like so many Brobdingnagians.
Most of them are very ugly; nevertheless
they contain the homes of many citizens,
and the continuous appearance of new and
larger specimens attests their increasing popularity.
Twenty years ago there was scarcely an
apartment-house to be seen in our cities. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
was a certain number of hotels where families
could and did live all the year round, but the
ten-story monster, with a janitor, an elevator,
steam heat, electric light, and all the alleged comforts
of home, was practically unknown. We
have always professed to be such a home-loving
people, and the so-called domestic hearth has
always been such a touchstone of sentiment
among us that the exchange of the family roof
for the community of a flat by so many well-to-do
persons certainly seems to suggest either that
living cheek by jowl with a number of other
households is not so distasteful as it seems to
the uninitiated, or else that modern housekeeping
is so irksome that women are tempted to
swallow sentiment and escape from their trammels
to the comparatively easy conditions of an
apartment. It does seem as though one’s identity
would be sacrificed or dimmed by becoming
a tenant in common, and as though the family
circle could never be quite the same thing to
one who was conscious that his was only a part
of one tremendous whole. And yet, more and
more people seem to be anxious to share a janitor
and front door, and, though the more fastidious
insist on their own cuisine, there are not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
a few content to entrust even their gastronomic
welfare to a kitchen in common.</p>

<p>It must be admitted, even by those of us who
rejoice in our homes, that there is much to be said
in favor of the apartment-house as a solver of
practical difficulties, and that our imaginations
are largely responsible for our antipathy. When
once inside a private apartment of the most desirable
and highly evolved kind one cannot but
admit that there is no real lack of privacy, and
that the assertion that the owner has no domestic
hearth is in the main incorrect. To be sure
the domain belonging to each suite is comparatively
circumscribed; there is no opportunity for
roaming from garret to cellar; no private laundry;
no private backyard; and no private front-door
steps; but to all practical intents one is no
less free from intrusion or inspection than in a
private house, and it may also be said that reporters
and other persevering visitors are kept
at a more respectful distance by virtue of the
janitor in common on the ground floor. The
sentiment in favor of limited individual possession
is difficult to eradicate from sensitive souls,
and rightly, perhaps, many of us refuse to be
convinced; but it remains true that the woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
who has become the mistress of a commodious
and well-managed apartment must have many
agreeable quarters of an hour in congratulating
herself that perplexities concerning chores, heating,
lighting, flights of stairs, leaks, and a host
of minor domestic matters no longer threaten
her peace of mind, and&mdash;greatest boon of all&mdash;that
she now can manage with two or three
servants instead of five or six.</p>

<p>In this newly developed fondness for flats we
are again guilty of imitating one of the effete
civilizations&mdash;France this time&mdash;where it has
long been the custom for families to content
themselves with a story or two instead of a
house; though we can claim the size and style
of architecture of the modern apartment pile as
our special brand upon the adopted institution.
The introduction of the custom here seems to me
to be the result of exhaustion of the female nervous
system. The American housewife, weary of
the struggle to obtain efficient servants, having
oscillated from all Catholics to all Protestants,
from all Irish to all Swedes and back again, having
experimented with negroes and Chinamen,
and returned to pure white, having tried native
help and been insulted, and reverted to the Celtic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
race, she&mdash;the long-suffering&mdash;has sought
the apartment-house as a haven of rest. She&mdash;the
long-suffering&mdash;has assuredly been in a false
position since the Declaration of Independence
declared that all men are created equal, for she
has been forced to cherish and preserve a domestic
institution which popular sentiment has
refused to recognize as consistent with the principles
of Democracy. Our National creed, whether
presented in the primer or from the platform,
has ever repudiated the idea of service
when accompanied by an abatement of personal
independence or confession of social inferiority.
Therefore the native American woman has persistently
refused, in the face of high wages and
of exquisite moral suasion, to enter domestic
service, and has preferred the shop or factory
to a comfortable home where she would have to
crook the knee and say “Yes, ma’am.”</p>

<p>At the same time the native American woman,
ever since “help” in the sense of social acquaintances
willing to accommodate for hire and dine
with the family has ceased to adorn her kitchen
and parlor, has been steadily forced by the demands
of complex modern living to have servants
of her own. And where was she to obtain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
them? Excepting the negro, only among the
emigrants of foreign countries, at first among
the Irish, and presently among the English and
Swedes, all of whom, unharassed by scruples as
to a consequent loss of self-respect, have been
prompt to recognize that this field of employment
lay open to them and was undisputed.
They have come, and they still come in herds
to our shores, raw and undisciplined, the overflow
from their own countries; and as fast as
they arrive they are feverishly snapped up by
the American housewife, who finds the need of
servants more and more imperative; for some
one must do the elaborate cooking, some one
must do the fine washing, some one must polish
the silver, rub the brasses, care for the lamps,
and dust the bric-à-brac in her handsomest establishment.
And no one but the emigrant, or the
son and daughter of the emigrant, is willing to.</p>

<p>The consequence is that, though the native
American woman is as resolute as ever in her
own refusal to be a cook or waitress in a private
family, domestic service exists as an institution
no less completely than it exists in Europe, and
practically under the same conditions, save that
servants here receive considerably higher wages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
than abroad because the demand is greater than
the supply. There is a perpetual wail in all our
cities and suburbs that the supply of competent
cooks, and skilled laundresses and maids is so
limited, and well-trained servants can demand
practically their own prices. The conditions of
service, however, are the same. That is, the servant
in the household of the free-born is still
the servant; and still the servant in the household
where the mistress, who has prospered,
would originally have gone into service had she
not been free-born. For there is no one more
prompt than the American housewife to keep a
servant when she can afford one, and the more
she is obliged to keep the prouder is she, though
her nervous system may give way under the
strain. By this I do not mean that the servants
here are ill-treated. On the contrary, the consideration
shown them is greater, and the quarters
provided for them are far more comfortable on
this side of the water than abroad. Indeed, servants
fare nowhere in the world so well as in the
establishments of the well-to-do people of our
large cities. Their bedrooms are suitable and often
tasteful, they are attended by the family physician
if ill, they are not overworked, and very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
slight checks are put on their liberty. But they
are undeniably servants. The free-born American
mistress does not regard her servants as social
equals. She expects them to stand up if they
are sitting down when she enters the room. She
expects them to address her sons and daughters
as Mr. Samuel and Miss Fanny, and to be called
in turn Maggie or Albertine (or Thompson or
Jones, <i lang="fr">à l’anglaise</i>) without a prefix. She does
her best, in short, to preserve all the forms and
all the deference on the one hand, and the haughtiness
or condescension on the other which govern
the relations between servant and mistress
abroad.</p>

<p>From the fact that we need so many more servants
than formerly, to care properly for our establishments,
the servant here is becoming more
and more of a machine. That is, she is in nearly
the same category with the electric light and the
furnace. We expect him or her to be as unobtrusive
as possible, to perform work without a hitch,
and not to draw upon our sympathies unnecessarily.
The mistress of one or two girls is sure to
grow friendly and concerned as to their outside
welfare, but when she has a staff of five or six, she
is thankful if she is not obliged to know anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
about them. The letter which appeared in a New
York newspaper some years ago, from an American
girl, in which she declared that she had left
service because her master and his sons handed
her their dripping umbrellas with the same air as
they would have handed them to a graven image,
was thoroughly in point. The reason the native
American girl will not become a servant, in spite
of the arguments of the rational and godly, is that
service is the sole employment in this country in
which she can be told with impunity that she is
the social inferior of any one else. It is the telling
which she cannot put up with. It is one thing to
be conscious that the person you are constantly
associated with is better educated, better mannered,
and more attractive than yourself, and it is
another to be told at every opportunity that this
is so. In the shop, in the factory, and in other
walks of life, whatever her real superiors may
think of her, they must treat her as a social equal.
Even that shrill-voiced, banged, bangled, impertinent,
slangy, vulgar product of our mammoth
retail drygoods system, who seems to believe
herself a pattern of ladylike behavior, is aware
in her heart that she does not know how to behave,
and yearns to resemble the well-bred woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
whom she daily insults. But the happiness of her
life, and its main-spring, too, lies in the consciousness
that she is free to become the first lady in
the land, and that she herself is to be her sole
critic and detractor. Why is she not right in refusing
to sacrifice her independence? Why should
she sell her birthright for a mess of pottage?</p>

<p>An anomalous condition of affairs is presented
by this contrast between the free-born American
woman as a mistress and as a revolter against
domestic service, and it seems to me that one of
two things must come to pass. Necessarily we
shall continue to have cooks, waiting-maids, and
laundresses; at least our food must be prepared,
our drawing-rooms dusted, and our linen ironed
by some one. But either we shall have to accept
and acknowledge the existence among us of a
class, recruited from foreign emigrants and their
descendants, which is tarred with the brush of
social proscription in direct violation of democratic
principles, or we must change the conditions
of domestic service&mdash;change them so that
condescension and servility vanish, and the contract
of service becomes like the other contracts
of employment between man and man, and man
and woman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>It is fruitless now to inquire what the free-born
American woman would have done without the
foreign emigrant to cook and wash for her. The
question is whether, now that she has her, she is
going to keep her, and keep her in the same comfortable
and well-paid but palpable thraldom as
at present. If so, she will be merely imitating the
housewives of the effete civilizations; she will be
doing simply what every English, French, and
German woman does and has done ever since
class distinctions began. But in that case, surely,
we shall be no longer able to proclaim our immunity
from caste, and our Fourth of July orators
will find some difficulty in showing that other
nations are more effete in this respect than ourselves.
Twenty-five years more of development
in our houses, hotels, and restaurants, if conducted
on present lines, will produce an enormous
ducking and scraping, fee-seeking, livery-wearing
servant class, which will go far to establish
the claim put forth by some of our critics, that
equality on this side of the water means only political
equality, and that our class distinctions,
though not so obvious, are no less genuine than
elsewhere. In this event the only logical note of
explanation to send to the Powers will be that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
social equality was never contemplated by the
signers of the Declaration of Independence, and
that, though it is true that any man may become
President of the United States, there are as great
inequalities in morals, intellect, and manners
among sons of liberty as among the subjects of
the Czar. To this the Powers will be justified
in uttering a disappointed and slightly ironical
“Oh!” But perhaps the foreign emigrant will
have something to say on the subject. Perhaps
the horde from across the seas, now lured by
high wages, will decrease in numbers, or it may
be that their descendants here will learn through
contact with the free-born revolter against domestic
service to revolt too.</p>

<p>What would the free-born American mistress
do then? With the free-born revolter still obdurate,
and the foreign emigrant ceasing to emigrate
or recalcitrant, she would be in an unpleasant
fix in her elaborate establishment conducted
on effete principles. In this practical dilemma,
rather than in an awakened moral sense, seems
to lie our best hope of regeneration, for it cannot
be denied that the free-born American mistress
is doing all she can at present to perpetuate the
foreign idea of domestic service, and it seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
probable that so long as the foreign emigrant is
willing to be bribed the true principles of democracy
will be violated. Already the difficulty of
obtaining servants is inducing home-loving families
to seek the apartment-house. A more distinct
dearth would speedily change the relations
between mistress and servant into that of contractor
and contractee, as in other employments
in this country. It may be that the descendants
of the emigrant will be unable to resist the lure
offered them, and that the free-born mistress
will triumph. If so, we shall become no better
and possibly no worse than the effete civilizations
we promised to make blush by the worth
of our institutions.</p>

<p class="dropcap">After a man and his wife have
made up their minds whether to
live in a town house or suburban
villa, they are obliged to consider
next what they will have
in the way of furniture, and presently what they
will have for dinner. The consciousness that a
house has nothing in it but the barest fixtures&mdash;the
gasometer, the water-tanks, and the electric
wires&mdash;and that it is for you and your wife
to decide exactly what shall go into it in the way
of wall-papers, carpets, upholstery, and objects
of virtu, is inspiring, even though your purse be
not plethoric and your knowledge of æsthetics
limited. The thought at once presents itself that
here is the chance of your lifetime to demonstrate
how beautiful and cosy a home may be, and you
set eagerly to work to surpass your predecessors
of equal means. It is a worthy ambition to endeavor
to make the matrimonial nest or the
home of maturer years attractive, and if we were
to peer back far enough into the past of even
this country, to the time when our great great-grandmothers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
set up housekeeping with our
great great-grandfathers, we should find that furnishing
was considered a seriously delightful matter,
though not perhaps the almost sacred trust
we regard it to-day. I mean our great great-grandparents
who used to live in those charming
old colonial houses, and who owned the mahogany
desks with brass handles and claw feet, the
tall clocks, the ravishing andirons, and all the
other old-fashioned furniture which is now so
precious and difficult to find. Distance may lend
such enchantment to a spinning-wheel, a warming-pan,
or a spinnet, that one is liable to become
hysterical in praise of them, and a calm, æsthetic
mind, outside the limits of an antique furniture
dealer’s store, would be justified in stigmatizing
many of the now cherished effects of our great
great-grandparents as truck; but, on the other
hand, who will dispute that they possessed very
many lovely things? They had an eye for graceful
shapes in their sideboards and tables; somehow
the curves they imparted to the backs of
their chairs cannot be duplicated now so as to
look the same; and the patterns of the satins,
flowered chintzes, and other stuffs which they
used for covers and curtains, exercise a witchery<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
upon us, even as we see them now frayed and
faded, which cannot proceed wholly from the
imagination.</p>

<p>They had no modern comforts, poor things;
no furnaces, no ice-chests, no set bath-tubs, no
running water, no sanitary improvements, no
gas or electric light; and their picturesque kitchen
hearths, with great caldrons and cranes and leather
blowers, must have been exceedingly inconvenient
to cook in; but even their most incommodious
appliances were not without artistic
charm.</p>

<p>After them came the deluge&mdash;the era of
horse-hair, the Sahara of democratic unloveliness,
when in every house, in every country
town, the set best room, which was never used
by the family, stood like a mortuary chapel
solely for the reception of guests. In the cities,
in the households of the then enlightened, rep&mdash;generally
green&mdash;was frequently substituted
for the sable horse-hair. Then came the days
when a dining-room or drawing-room was furnished
in one pervasive hue&mdash;a suit of sables, a
brick red, a dark green, or a deep maroon. Everything
matched; the chairs and tables, desks
and book-cases were bought in sets at one fell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
swoop by the householder of the period who desired
to produce artistic effects. For forty years
or so this was the prevailing fashion, and the
limit of purely indigenous expression.</p>

<p>To it presently succeeded the æsthetic phase,
borrowed from England. Then, instead of selecting
everything to match, a young or old couple
bought so as just not to match, but to harmonize.
All sorts of queer and subtle shades and tints
in wall-papers and fabrics appeared, principally
dallyings with and improvisings upon green,
brown, and yellow; frescos and dados were the
rage; and a wave of interest in the scope and
mission of eccentric color spread over the land.
Valuable as this movement was as an educational
factor, there was nothing American in it; or in
other words, we were again simply imitative. The
very fact, however, that we were ready to imitate,
betokened that horse-hair and rep had ceased
to satisfy national aspiration, and that we were
willing to accept suggestions from without, inasmuch
as no native prophet had arisen. But
though the impetus came from abroad, the awakening
was genuine. Since then the desire to furnish
tastefully has been steadily waxing among
the more well-to-do portion of the population.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
As in the case of architecture, the increasing interest
has called into existence a professional
class, which, though still small and less generally
employed than their house-designing brethren,
is beginning to play an important part in the
education of the public taste in internal house
decoration and equipment. The idea that any
man or woman may be more fitted than his
or her neighbor to choose a carpet or a wall-paper
has been grudgingly admitted, and still
irritates the average house-owner who is ready
to furnish. But the masters, and more conspicuously
the mistresses, of the competing superb
establishments in our cities, have learned, from
the sad experience of some of their predecessors,
to swallow their individual trust in their
own powers of selection, and to put themselves
unreservedly into the clutches of a professional
house decorator.</p>

<p>Furnishing a mammoth establishment from
top to bottom with somebody else’s money, and
plenty of it, must be a delightful occupation.
There can be no carking consciousness of price
to act as a drag on genius, and it would seem as
though the house decorator who was not interfered
with under these circumstances had a rare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
chance to show what is what. When he fails,
which is by no means out of the question, he
can ordinarily shift the responsibility on to his
employer, for an employer can rarely resist the
temptation of insisting on some one touch to
prove his or her own capacity, and of course it
is a simple matter for the man of art to demonstrate
that this one touch has spoiled everything.
The temptation to try to be as original and captivating
in results as possible must be almost irresistible,
especially when one’s elbow is constantly
jogged by furniture and other dealers,
who are only too eager to reproduce a Directory
drawing-room or any other old-time splendor.
But there is no denying that, whatever his limitations,
the house decorator is becoming the best
of educators on this side of the water, for though
we cannot afford or have too much confidence in
our own taste to employ him, our wives watch
him like cats and are taking in his ideas through
the pores, if not directly.</p>

<p>There are, it is true, almost as many diverse
styles of internal ornamentation as of external architecture
in our modern residences, for everyone
who has, or thinks he has, an aptitude for furnishing
is trying his professional or ’prentice hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
sometimes with startling results; yet the diversities
seem less significant than in the case of external
architecture, or perhaps it may be said that
the sum total of effect is much nearer to finality
or perfection. If as a nation we are deriving the
inspiration for the furniture and upholsteries of
our drawing-rooms and libraries from the best
French and Dutch models of a century or more
ago, we certainly can boast that the comfortable
features which distinguish our apartments from
their prototypes are a native growth. If as a people
we cannot yet point to great original artistic
triumphs, may we not claim the spacious and dignified
contemporary refrigerator, the convenient
laundry, the frequently occurring and palatial
bath-room, the health-conducing ventilator-pipe
and sanitary fixtures, and the various electrical
and other pipes, tubes, and appliances which
have become a part of every well-ordered house,
as a national cult? To be genuinely comfortable
in every-day life seems to have become the aim
all the world over of the individual seeking to
live wisely, and the rest of the world is in our
debt for the many valuable mechanical aids to
comfort in the home which have been invented
on this side of the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>This quest for comfort is being constantly
borne in mind also in the æsthetic sense. We
fit our drawing-rooms now to live in as well as
to look at. We expect to sit on our sofas and in
our easy chairs; hence we try to make them attractive
to the back as well as to the eye. Though
our wives may still occasionally pull down the
window-shades to exclude a too dangerous sun,
they no longer compel us to view our best rooms
from the threshold as a cold, flawless, forbidden
land. The extreme æsthetic tendencies which were
rampant twenty years ago have been toned down
by this inclination, among even our most elaborate
house-furnishers, to produce the effect that
rooms are intended for every-day use by rational
beings. The ultra-queer colors have disappeared,
and the carpets and wall-papers no longer suggest
perpetual biliousness or chronic nightmare.</p>

<p>I think, too, the idea that a drawing-room can
be made bewitchingly cosey by crowding it with
all one’s beautiful and ugly earthly possessions
has been demonstrated to be a delusion. In these
days of many wedding presents, it is difficult for
young people to resist the temptation of showing
all they have received. I remember that Mrs.
George J. Spriggs&mdash;she was the daughter, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
will remember, of ex-Assistant Postmaster-General
Homer W. Green&mdash;had seven lamps in her
parlor in Locust Road, three of them with umbrageous
Japanese shades. Her husband explained
to me that there had been a run on
lamps and pepper-pots in their individual case.</p>

<p>Now, Mrs. Julius Cæsar would have managed
more cleverly. She would have made the lamp-dealer
exchange four or five of the lamps for, say,
an ornamental brass fender, a brass coal-scuttle,
or a Japanese tea-tray, and have made the jeweller
substitute some equally desirable table ornaments
for the pepper-pots. And yet, when I made
my wedding call on Mrs. Cæsar, ten years ago, I
remember thinking that her drawing-room was a
sort of compromise between a curiosity shop and
a menagerie. To begin with, I stumbled over the
head of a tiger skin, which confronted me as I
passed through the <i lang="fr">portière</i>, so that I nearly fell
into the arms of my hostess. It seemed to me
that I had stepped into a veritable bazaar. A large
bear skin lay before the fire as a hearth-rug, and
on either side of the grate squatted a large, orientally
conceived china dragon with an open
mouth. Here and there, under furniture or in
corners, were gaping frogs in bronze or china. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
low plush-covered table was densely arrayed with
small china dogs of every degree. On another
table was spread a number of silver ornaments&mdash;a
silver snuff-box, a silver whistle, a silver feather,
a silver match-box, and a silver shoe-buckle&mdash;all
objects of virtu of apparently antique workmanship.
There were three lamps with ornamental
shades&mdash;a fluted china shade, a paper shade in
semblance of a full-blown rose, and a yellow satin
shade with drooping fringe. From the low studded
ceiling depended a vast Japanese paper lantern.
Sundry and divers china vases and shepherdesses
occupied the mantel-piece and the top
of the book-case, and had overflowed on to a writing-table
supplied with brass ornaments. There
were numerous pictures, large and small, on the
walls, under many of which colored china plates
had been hung. There were photographs in frames
everywhere. The actual space where I could stand
without knocking over anything was about the
size of a hat bath, and was shut in by a circle of
low chairs and divans besprinkled with æsthetic
yellow, green, and pink soft silk cushions. On
one of these divans my hostess was reclining in
a Grosvenor gallery tea-gown, so that she seemed
to wallow in cushions, and Julius Cæsar himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
was sunk in the depths of one of the chairs, so
near the ground that his knees seemed to rest on
his chin, and one might fairly have taken him for
another china frog of extraordinary proportions.
All this in a comparatively small room where
there were several other knick-knacks which I
have omitted to mention. Better this, perhaps,
than the drawing-room of forty years ago, when
the visitor’s gaze was bounded by cold green rep,
and he was restrained only by decorum from hurling
into the fire the tidy or antimacassar which
tickled his neck, or detached itself and wriggled
down between his back and the back of the chair.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Cæsar’s drawing-room, in her new
house on Belport Avenue, has been furnished
from a very different point of view than her first
one, which shows how rapidly tastes change in
a progressive society. Mrs. Cæsar and Julius
chose everything themselves this time as they
did before, but they had learned from experience,
and from the new work of the contemporary
decorator. There is plenty of unoccupied
space now to show her possessions to advantage,
and there are not too many possessions visible
for the size of the parlor; there is neither so
much uniformity of color and design as to weary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the eye, nor so much variety or eccentricity as
to irritate it; consequently, the effect on the visitor
is not that he is in a room intended for luxurious
display, but in an exquisitely furnished
room adapted for daily use. In other words, the
controlling idea at present, of those who seek to
make their houses charming, seems to be to
combine comfort with elegance so skilfully that
while one may realize the latter, one is conscious
only of the former. Though decorators are still
experimenting, as probably they always will be,
to attain novel effects, they are disposed to make
use of queer or attenuated hues, Moorish blazonry,
stamped leather, peacock feathers, elephant
tusks, stained-glass windows, and Japanese
lacquer-work with much more discretion than a
few years ago. Virgin-white instead of dirt-brown
lights up our halls and stair-cases, and the vast
chandeliers which used to dazzle the eye no
longer dangle from the ceiling. Indeed, it seems
as though it would be difficult to make the interior
of the homes of our well-to-do class more
comfortable and attractive than they are at present.
It may be that some of our very rich people
are disposed to waste their energies in devising
and striving for more consummate elegance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
thereby exposing us all to the charge that we are
becoming too luxurious for our spiritual good.
But there can be little question that the ambition
to surround one’s self with as much beauty, consistent
with comfort, as one can afford is desirable,
even from the ethical standpoint.</p>

<p>Undeniably our point of view has changed extraordinarily
in the last thirty years in regard to
house-furnishing, as in regard to so many other
matters of our material welfare, and there certainly
is some ground for fearing that the pendulum
is swinging just at present too far in the
direction opposite to that of high thinking and
low living; but, after all, though the reaction
from ugliness has been and continues to be exuberant,
it is as yet by no means wide-embracing.
In fact, our cultivated well-to-do class&mdash;though
it is well abreast of the rest of the civilized world
in aspiration and not far behind it in accomplishment,
with certain vivifying traits of its own
which the old world societies do not possess or
have lost&mdash;is still comparatively small; and
there is still so much Stygian darkness outside it
in respect to house-furnishing and home comfort
in general, that we can afford to have the exuberance
continue for the present; for there is some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
reason to believe that most of the descendants
of our old high thinkers have become high livers,
or at least, if low livers, have ceased to be high
thinkers. Mutton-soup for breakfast and unattractive
domestic surroundings seem to comport
nowadays with ignoble aims, if nothing worse;
moreover, it must not be forgotten that the plain
people of the present is no longer the plain people
of forty years ago, but is largely the seed of
the influx of foreign peasants, chiefly inferior
and often scum, which the sacredness of our institutions
has obliged us to receive.</p>

<p class="dropcap">If we have become cosmopolitan in
the matter of domestic comfort and
elegance as regards our drawing-rooms,
the same is certainly true of
our dining-rooms, and dinner-tables. But here
it seems to me that we are more justly open to
criticism on the score of over-exuberance. That
is, the fairly well-to-do class, for the plain people
of foreign blood, and the low liver of native
blood, eat almost as indigestible food, and quite
as rapidly and unceremoniously, as the pie and
doughnut nurtured yeoman of original Yankee
stock, who thrived in spite of his diet, and left
to his grandchildren the heritage of dyspepsia
which has become nervous prostration in the present
generation. It seems as though our instincts
of hospitality have grown in direct ratio with our
familiarity with and adoption of civilized creature
comforts, and any charge of exuberance
may doubtless be fairly ascribed to the national
trait of generosity, the abuse of which is after
all a noble blemish. But, on the other hand,
facts remain, even after one has given a pleasing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
excuse for their existence, and it may be doubted
if a spendthrift is long consoled by the reflection
that his impecuniosity is due to his own disinclination
to stint. May it not truthfully be
charged against the reasonably well-to-do American
citizen that he has a prejudice against thrift,
especially where the entertainment of his fellow
man or woman is concerned? The rapid growth
of wealth and the comparative facility of becoming
rich during the last half century of our development,
has operated against the practice of
small economies, so that we find ourselves now
beset by extravagant traditions which we hesitate
to deviate from for fear of seeming mean.
Many a man to-day pays his quarter of a dollar
ruefully and begrudgingly to the colored Pullman
car porter at the end of his journey, when
he is “brushed off,” because he cannot bring himself
to break the custom which fixed the fee. It
would be interesting to estimate what the grand
total of saving to the American travelling public
would have been if ten instead of twenty-five
cents a head had been paid to the tyrant in question
since he first darkened the situation. If not
enough to maintain free schools for the negro, at
least sufficient to compel railroad managements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
to give their employees suitable wages instead
of letting the easy-going traveller, who has already
paid for the privilege of a reserved seat,
pay a premium on that. The exorbitant fees bestowed
on waiters is but another instance of a
tendency to be over-generous, which, once reduced
to custom, becomes the severest kind of
tax, in that it is likely to affect the warmest-hearted
people.</p>

<p>This tendency to be needlessly lavish in expenditure
is most conspicuous when we are offering
hospitality in our own homes. Among the
viands which we have added to the bills of fare
of humanity, roast turkey and cranberry-sauce,
Indian meal, and probably baked beans, are entitled
to conspicuous and honorable mention, but
is it not true, notwithstanding champagne is a
foreign wine, that the most prodigious discovery
in the line of food or drink yet made by the well-to-do
people of this country, is the discovery of
champagne? Does it not flow in one golden effervescing
stream, varied only by the pops caused
by the drawing of fresh corks, from the Statue
of Liberty Enlightening the World to the Golden
Gate? And the circumstance that every pop
costs the entertainer between three and four dollars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
seems in no wise to interrupt the cheery explosions.
There are some people who do not
drink champagne or any other wine, from principle,
and there are some with whom it does not
agree, but the average individual finds that the
interest of festive occasions is heightened by its
presence in reasonable abundance, and is apt to
deplore its total absence with internal groans.
But surely ninety-nine men in our large cities
out of one hundred, who are accustomed to entertain
and be entertained, must be weary of the
sight of this expensive tempter at the feast, which
it is so difficult to refuse when set before one, and
which is so often quaffed against better judgment
or inclination. The champagne breakfast, the
champagne luncheon, the champagne dinner, and
the champagne supper, with a champagne cocktail
tossed in as a stop-gap, hound the social favorite
from January to December, until he is fain
to dream of the Old Oaken Bucket, and sooner
or later to drink Lithia water only.</p>

<p>With perpetual and unremitting champagne
as the key-note of social gatherings, no wonder
that the table ornaments and the comestibles become
more splendid. A little dinner of eight or
ten is no longer a simple matter of a cordial invitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
and an extra course. The hostess who
bids her contemporaries to dine with her most
informally ten days hence, uses a figure of speech
which is innocuous from the fact that it is known
to be a deliberate falsehood. She begins generally
by engaging a cook from outside to prepare
the dinner, which must surely wound the sensibilities
of any self-respecting couple the first time,
however hardened to the situation they may become
later.</p>

<p>At this stage of my reflections I am interrupted
by my wife, Barbara&mdash;for I was thinking aloud&mdash;with
a few words of expostulation.</p>

<p>“Are you not a little severe? I assume that
you are referring now to people with a comfortable
income, but who are not disgustingly rich.
Of course, nowadays, the very rich people keep
cooks who can cook for a dinner-party, cooks at
eight dollars or more a week and a kitchen maid;
so it is only the hostess with a cook at four and
a half to six dollars a week and no kitchen maid
who is likely to engage an accommodator. But
what is the poor thing to do? Give a wretched,
or plain dinner which may make her hair grow
white in a single night? Surely, when a woman
invites friends to her house she does not wish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
them to go away half starved, or remembering
that they have had disagreeable things to eat.
In that case she would prefer not to entertain at
all.”</p>

<p>“The question is,” I answered, “whether it is
more sensible to try to be content with what one
has, or to vie with those who are better off. We
do not attempt to dine on gold plate, nor have
we a piano decorated with a five-thousand-dollar
painting by one of the great artists, like Patterson,
the banker. Why should we endeavor to
compete with his kitchen?”</p>

<p>“The clever thing, of course, is to find a cook
for six dollars a week who can cook for a dinner-party,”
answered Barbara, pensively; “and yet,”
she added, “though our cook can, the chances are
that nine out of ten of the people who dine with
us think that we hired her for the occasion.”</p>

<p>“Precisely. Just because the custom has grown
so. It is sheer extravagance.”</p>

<p>“After all, my dear, it is a comparatively small
matter&mdash;a five-dollar bill.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me. Five dollars for the cook, because
one’s own cook is not good enough; three
or five dollars for an accommodating maid or
waiter, because you cannot trust your chamber-maid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
to assist your waitress; eight dollars for
champagne, and so on.”</p>

<p>“Do not say ‘your’&mdash;mine can.”</p>

<p>“Her, then&mdash;the woman of the day. I am trying
to show that a small informal dinner is a
cruelly expensive affair for the average man with
a comfortable working income.”</p>

<p>“I admit that a dinner for eight or ten is expensive,”
said Barbara. “It means twenty-five
dollars at the lowest, even if you have your own
cook. But what is one to do? You don’t seem
to appreciate that a good plain cook cannot usually
prepare dinner-party dishes, and that a plain
dinner is now almost as different from a dinner-party
dinner as a boiled egg is from caviare.”</p>

<p>“Precisely. There is the pity of it. The growth
here of the French restaurant and the taste for
rich and elaborate cookery has doubtless been a
good thing in its way, if only that it is now possible
to obtain a tolerably well-cooked meal at
most of the hotels in our large cities and principal
watering-places; but why should people of moderate
means and social instincts feel constrained
to offer a banquet on every occasion when they
entertain? I for one consider it a bore to have
so much provided when I go out to dinner.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“You must admit,” said Barbara, “that dinners
are not nearly so long as they were a few
years ago. Now, by means of the extra service
you complain of, and by keeping the number of
courses down, a dinner ought not to last longer
than an hour and a half, whereas it used to take
two hours and over. In England they are much
worse than here. You are given, for instance,
two puddings, one after the other, and ices to
follow.”</p>

<p>“I agree,” said I, “that we have curtailed the
length so that there is not much to complain of
on that score. I think, though, that comparatively
plain dishes well served are quite as apt
to please as the aspics, chartreuses, timbales, and
other impressive gallicisms under which the accommodating
party cook is wont to cater to the
palates of informally invited guests. I sometimes
think that the very few of our great great-grandfathers
who knew how to live at all must have
had more appetizing tables than we. Their family
cooks, from all accounts, knew how to roast and
boil and bake and stew, culinary arts which somehow
seem to be little understood by the chefs
of to-day. Then again, the old-fashioned Delft
crockery&mdash;blue ships sailing on a blue sea&mdash;was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
very attractive. Our modern dinner-tables, when
arrayed for a party, have almost too much fuss
and feathers. Women worry until they get cut
glass, if it is not given them as a wedding present,
and several sets of costly plates&mdash;Sèvres,
Dresden, or Crown Derby&mdash;are apt to seem
indispensable to housekeepers of comparatively
limited means.”</p>

<p>“Cut glass is lovely, and the same plates
through seven courses are rather trying,” said
Barbara, parenthetically.</p>

<p>“Of course it is lovely, and I am very glad
you have some. But is not the modern American
woman of refined sensibilities just a little too
eager to crowd her table with every article of
virtu she possesses&mdash;every ornamental spoon,
dish, cup, and candlestick&mdash;until one is unable
to see at any one spot more than a square inch
of tablecloth? In the centre of the table she sets
a crystal bowl of flowers, a silver basket of ferns,
or a dish of fruit. This is flanked by apostle or
gold-lined spoons, silver dishes of confectionery
of various kinds, silver candlesticks or candelabra
fitted with pink or saffron shades, one or two
of which are expected to catch fire, an array of
cut glass or Venetian glass at every plate, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
like as not, pansies strewn all over the table.”</p>

<p>“The modern dinner-table is very pretty,”
responded Barbara. “I don’t see how it could
be improved materially.”</p>

<p>“I dare say, but somehow one can’t help
thinking at times that the effort for effect is too
noticeable, and that the real object of sitting down
to dinner in company, agreeable social intercourse,
is consequently lost sight of. If only the
very rich were guilty of wanton display, the answer
would be that the rank and file of our well-to-do,
sensible people have very simple entertainments.
Unfortunately, while the very rich
are constantly vying to outstrip one another, the
dinner-table and the dinner of the well-to-do
American are each growing more and more complex
and elaborate. Perhaps not more so than
abroad among the nobility or people of means;
but certainly we have been Europeanized in this
respect to such an extent that, not only is there
practically nothing left for us to learn in the way
of being luxurious, but I am not sure that we
are not disposed to convince the rest of the civilized
world that a free-born American, when
fully developed, can be the most luxurious individual
on earth.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>Barbara looked a little grave at this. “Everything
used to be so ugly and unattractive a little
while ago that I suppose our heads have been
turned,” she answered. “After this I shall make
a rule, when we give a dinner-party, to keep one-half
of my table ornaments in the safe as a rebuke
to my vanity. Only if I am to show so
much of the tablecloth, I shall have to buy some
with handsome patterns. Don’t you see?”</p>

<p>Perhaps this suggestion that our heads have
been turned for the time being by our national
prosperity, and that they will become straight
again in due course of time, is the most sensible
view to take of the situation. There can be no
doubt that among well-to-do people, who would
object to be classed in “the smart set,” as the reporters
of social gossip odiously characterize
those prominent in fashionable society in our
large cities, the changes in the last thirty years
connected with every-day living, as well as with
entertaining, have all been in the direction of
cosmopolitan usage. It is now only a very old-fashioned
or a very blatant person who objects to
the use of evening dress at the dinner-table, or
the theatre, as inconsistent with true patriotism.
The dinner-hour has steadily progressed from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
twelve o’clock noon until it has halted at seven
<i lang="la">post</i> meridian, as the ordinary hour for the most
formal meal of the day, with further postponement
to half-past seven or even eight among the
fashionable for the sake of company. The frying-pan
and the tea-pot have ceased to reign supreme
as the patron saints of female nutrition,
and the beefsteak, the egg, both cooked and raw,
milk and other flesh-and-blood-producing food
are abundantly supplied to the rising generation
of both sexes by the provident parent of to-day.
The price of beef in our large cities has steadily
advanced in price until its use as an article of
diet is a serious monster to encounter in the
monthly bills, but the husband and father who
is seeking to live wisely, seems not to be deterred
from providing it abundantly.</p>

<p>From this it is evident that if we are unduly
exuberant in the pursuit of creature comforts, it
is not solely in the line of purely ornamental luxuries.
If we continue to try our nervous systems
by undue exertion, they are at least better fitted
to stand the strain, by virtue of plenty of nutritious
food, even though dinner-parties tempt us
now and then to over-indulgence, or bore us by
their elaborateness. Yet it remains to be seen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
whether the income of the American husband
and father will be able to stand the steady drain
occasioned by the liberal table he provides, and
it may be that we have some lessons in thrift on
this score still in store for us. There is this consolation,
that if our heads have been turned in
this respect also, and we are supplying more food
for our human furnaces than they need, the force
of any reaction will not fall on us, but on the
market-men, who are such a privileged class that
our candidates for public office commonly provide
a rally for their special edification just before
election-day, and whose white smock-frocks
are commonly a cloak for fat though greasy
purses. Yet Providence seems to smile on the
market-man in that it has given him the telephone,
through which the modern mistress can
order her dinner, or command chops or birds,
when unexpected guests are foreshadowed. Owing
to the multiplicity of the demands upon the
time of both men and women, the custom of
going to market in person has largely fallen into
decay. The butcher and grocer send assistants
to the house for orders, and the daily personal
encounter with the smug man in white, which
used to be as inevitable as the dinner, has now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
mainly been relegated to the blushing bride of
from one week to two years’ standing, and the
people who pay cash for everything. Very likely
we are assessed for the privilege of not being
obliged to nose our turkeys and see our chops
weighed in advance, and it is difficult to answer
the strictures of those who sigh for what they
call the good old times, when it was every man’s
duty, before he went to his office, to look over
his butcher’s entire stock and select the fattest
and juiciest edibles for the consumption of himself
and family. As for paying cash for everything,
my wife Barbara says that, unless people
are obliged to be extremely economical, no woman
in this age of nervous prostration ought to
run the risk of bringing on that dire malady by
any such imprudence, and that to save five dollars
a month on a butcher’s bill, and pay twenty-five
to a physician for ruined nerves, is false political
economy.</p>

<p>“I agree with you,” she added, “that we
Americans live extravagantly in the matter of
daily food&mdash;especially meat&mdash;as compared with
the general run of people in other countries; but
far more serious than our appetites and liberal
habits, in my opinion, is the horrible waste which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
goes on in our kitchens, due to the fact that our
cooks are totally ignorant of the art of making the
most of things. Abroad, particularly on the Continent,
they understand how to utilize every scrap,
so that many a comfortable meal is provided from
what our servants habitually cast into the swill-tub.
Here there is perpetual waste&mdash;waste&mdash;waste,
and no one seems to understand how to prevent
it. There you have one never-failing reason
for the size of our butchers’ and grocers’ bills.”</p>

<p>I assume that my wife, who is an intelligent
person, must be correct in this accusation of
general wastefulness which she makes against the
American kitchen. If so, here we are confronted
again with the question of domestic service from
another point of view. How long can we afford
to throw our substance into the swill-tub? If our
emigrant cooks do not understand the art of utilizing
scraps and remnants, are we to continue to
enrich our butchers without let or hindrance? It
would seem that if the American housewife does
not take this matter in hand promptly, the cruel
laws of political economy will soon convince her
by grisly experience that neither poetry nor philanthropy
can flourish in a land where there is
perpetual waste below stairs.</p>

<p class="dropcap">On occasions of oratory in this
country, nothing will arouse an
audience more quickly than an
allusion to our public school system,
and any speaker who sees
fit to apostrophize it is certain to be fervidly
applauded. Moreover, in private conversation,
whether with our countrymen or with foreigners,
every citizen is prone to indulge in the statement,
commonly uttered with some degree of
emotion, that our public schools are the great
bulwarks of progressive democracy. Why, then,
is the American parent, as soon as he becomes
well-to-do, apt to send his children elsewhere?</p>

<p>I was walking down town with a friend the
other day, and he asked me casually where I sent
my boys to school. When I told him that they
attended a public school he said, promptly, “Good
enough. I like to see a man do it. It’s the right
thing.” I acquiesced modestly; then, as I knew
that he had a boy of his own, I asked him the
same question.</p>

<p>“My son,” he replied slowly, “goes to Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
Bingham’s”&mdash;indicating a private school for
boys in the neighborhood. “He is a little delicate&mdash;that
is, he had measles last summer, and
has never quite recovered his strength. I had almost
made up my mind to send him to a public
school, so that he might mix with all kinds of
boys, but his mother seemed to think that the
chances of his catching scarlet fever or diphtheria
would be greater, and she has an idea that he
would make undesirable acquaintances and learn
things which he shouldn’t. So, on the whole,
we decided to send him to Bingham’s. But I
agree that you are right.”</p>

<p>There are many men in the community who,
like my friend, believe thoroughly that every one
would do well to send his boys to a public school&mdash;that
is, every one but themselves. When it
comes to the case of their own flesh and blood
they hesitate, and in nine instances out of ten, on
some plea or other, turn their backs on the principles
they profess. This is especially true in our
cities, and it has been more or less true ever since
the Declaration of Independence; and as a proof
of the flourishing condition of the tendency at
present, it is necessary merely to instance the
numerous private schools all over the country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
The pupils at these private schools are the children
of our people of means and social prominence,
the people who ought to be the most patriotic
citizens of the Republic.</p>

<p>I frankly state that I, for one, would not send
my boys to a public school unless I believed the
school to be a good one. Whatever other motives
may influence parents, there is no doubt
that many are finally deterred from sending their
boys to a public school by the conviction that the
education offered to their sons in return for taxes
is inferior to what can be obtained by private contract.
Though a father may be desirous to have
his boys understand early the theory of democratic
equality, he may well hesitate to let them
remain comparatively ignorant in order to impress
upon them this doctrine. In this age, when
so much stress is laid on the importance of giving
one’s children the best education possible, it seems
too large a price to pay. Why, after all, should
a citizen send his boys to a school provided by
the State, if better schools exist in the neighborhood
which he can afford to have them attend?</p>

<p>This conviction on the part of parents is certainly
justified in many sections of the country,
and when justifiable, disarms the critic who is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
prepared to take a father to task for sending his
children to a private school. Also, it is the only
argument which the well-to-do aristocrat can successfully
protect himself behind. It is a full suit
of armor in itself, but it is all he has. Every other
excuse which he can give is flimsy as tissue-paper,
and exposes him utterly. Therefore, if the State
is desirous to educate the sons of its leading citizens,
it ought to make sure that the public schools
are second to none in the land. If it does not, it
has only itself to blame if they are educated apart
from the sons of the masses of the population.
Nor is it an answer to quote the Fourth of July
orator, that our public schools are second to none
in the world; for one has only to investigate to
be convinced that, both as regards the methods
of teaching and as regards ventilation, many of
them all over the country are signally inferior to
the school as it should be, and the school, both
public and private, as it is in certain localities.
So long as school boards and committees, from
the Atlantic to the Pacific, are composed mainly
of political aspirants without experience in educational
matters, and who seek to serve as a first or
second step toward the White House, our public
schools are likely to remain only pretty good. So<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
long as people with axes to grind, or, more plainly
speaking, text-books to circulate, are chosen to
office, our public schools are not likely to improve.
So long&mdash;and here is the most serious
factor of all&mdash;so long as the well-to-do American
father and mother continue to be sublimely indifferent
to the condition of the public schools,
the public schools will never be so good as they
ought to be.</p>

<p>It must certainly be a source of constant discouragement
to the earnest-minded people in this
country, who are interested in education, and are
at the same time believers in our professed national
hostility to class distinctions, that the well-to-do
American parent so calmly turns his back
on the public schools, and regards them very
much from the lofty standpoint from which certain
persons are wont to regard religion&mdash;as an
excellent thing for the masses, but superfluous for
themselves. Of course, if we are going, in this respect
also, to model ourselves on and imitate the
older civilizations, there is nothing to be said. If
the public schools are to be merely a semi-charitable
institution for children whose parents cannot
afford to separate them from the common
herd, the discussion ceases. But what becomes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
then, of our cherished and Fourth of July sanctified
theories of equality and common school
education? And what do we mean when we prate
of a common humanity, and no upper class?</p>

<p>It is in the city or town, where the public
school is equal or superior to the private school,
that the real test comes. Yet in these places well-to-do
parents seem almost as indifferent as when
they have the righteous defence that their children
would be imperfectly educated, or breathe
foul air, were they to be sent to a public school.
They take no interest, and they fairly bristle
with polite and ingenious excuses for evading
compliance with the institutions of their country.
This is true, probably, of three-fifths of those
parents, who can afford, if necessary, to pay for
private instruction. And having once made the
decision that, for some reason, a public school
education is not desirable for their children, they
feel absolved from further responsibility and
practically wash their hands of the matter. It is
notorious that a very large proportion of the
children of the leading bankers, merchants, professional
men, and other influential citizens, who
reside in the so-called court end of our large
cities, do not attend the public schools, and it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
equally notorious that the existence of a well-conducted
and satisfactory school in the district
affects the attendance comparatively little. If
only this element of the population, which is
now so indifferent, would interest itself actively,
what a vast improvement could be effected in
our public school system! If the parents in the
community, whose standards of life are the highest,
and whose ideas are the most enlightened,
would as a class co-operate in the advancement
of common education, the charge that our public
schools produce on the whole second-rate acquirements,
and second-rate morals and manners,
would soon be refuted, and the cause of popular
education would cease to be handicapped, as it is
at present, by the coolness of the well-to-do class.
If the public schools, in those sections of our
cities where our most intelligent and influential
citizens have their homes, are unsatisfactory,
they could speedily be made as good as any private
school, were the same interest manifested
by the tax-payers as is shown when an undesirable
pavement is laid, or a company threatens to
provide rapid transit before their doors. Unfortunately,
that same spirit of aloofness, which has
in the past operated largely to exclude this element<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
in the nation from participation in the affairs
of popular government, seems to be at the
bottom of this matter. Certainly much progress
has been made in the last twenty years in remedying
the political evil, and the public good appears
to demand a change of front from the same
class of people on the subject of common education,
unless we are prepared to advocate the existence
and growth of a favored, special class, out
of touch with, and at heart disdainful of, the
average citizen.</p>

<p>The most serious enemies of the public schools
among well-to-do people appear to be women.
Many a man, alive to the importance of educating
his sons in conformity with the spirit of our
Constitution, would like to send his boys to a
public school, but is deterred by his wife. A
mother accustomed to the refinements of modern
civilization is apt to shrink from sending her
fleckless darling to consort, and possibly become
the boon companion or bosom friend, of a street
waif.</p>

<p>She urges the danger of contamination, both
physical and moral, and is only too glad to discover
an excuse for refusing to yield. “Would
you like to have your precious boy sit side by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
side with a little negro?” I was asked one day,
in horrified accents, by a well-to-do American
mother; and I have heard many fears expressed
by others that their offspring would learn vice,
or contract disease, through daily association
with the children of the mass. It is not unjust to
state that the average well-to-do mother is gratified
when the public school, to which her sons
would otherwise be sent, is so unsatisfactory that
their father’s patriotism is overborne by other
considerations. All theories of government or humanity
are lost sight of in her desire to shelter
her boys, and the simplest way to her seems to
be to set them apart from the rest of creation, instead
of taking pains to make sure that they are
suitably taught and protected side by side with
the other children of the community.</p>

<p>Excellent as many of our private schools are,
it is doubtful if either the morals are better, or
the liability to disease is less, among the children
who attend them than at a public school of the
best class. To begin with, the private schools in
our cities are eagerly patronized by that not inconsiderable
class of parents who hope or imagine
that the social position of their children is to
be established by association with the children of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
influential people. Falsehood, meanness, and unworthy
ambitions are quite as dangerous to character,
when the little man who suggests them has
no patches on his breeches, as when he has, and
unfortunately there are no outward signs on the
moral nature, like holes in trousers, to serve as
danger signals to our darlings. Then again, those
of us who occupy comfortable houses in desirable
localities, will generally find on investigation
that the average of the class of children which attend
the public school in such a district is much
superior to what paternal or maternal fancy has
painted. In such a district the children of the
ignorant emigrant class are not to be found in
large numbers. The pupils consist mainly of the
rank and file of the native American population,
whose tendencies and capacities for good have
always been, and continue to be, the basis of our
strength as a people. There is no need that a
mother with delicate sensibilities should send her
son into the slums in order to obtain for him a
common school education; she has merely to consent
that he take his chances with the rest of the
children of the district in which he lives, and
bend her own energies to make the standards of
that school as high as possible. In that way she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
will best help to raise the tone of the community
as a whole, and best aid to obliterate those
class distinctions which, in spite of Fourth of
July negations, are beginning to expose us to the
charge of insincerity.</p>

<p>When a boy has reached the age of eleven or
twelve, another consideration presents itself
which is a source of serious perplexity to parents.
Shall he be educated at home&mdash;that is, attend
school in his own city or town&mdash;or be sent
to one of the boarding-schools or academies
which are ready to open their doors to him and
fit him for college? Here again we are met by
the suggestion that the boarding-school of this
type is not a native growth, but an exotic. England
has supplied us with a precedent. The great
boarding-schools, Rugby, Eton, and Harrow,
are the resort of the gentlemen of England.
Though termed public schools, they are class
schools, reserved and intended for the education
of only the highly respectable. The sons of the
butcher, the baker, and candlestick-maker are not
formally barred, but they are tacitly excluded.
The pupils are the sons of the upper and well-to-do
middle classes. A few boarding-schools for
boys have been in existence here for many years,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
but in the last twenty there has been a notable
increase in their number and importance. These,
too, are essentially class schools, for though ostensibly
open to everybody, the charges for tuition
and living are beyond the means of parents
with a small income. Most of them are schools
of a religious denomination, though commonly
a belief in the creed for which the institution
stands is not made a formal requisite for admission.
The most successful profess the Episcopalian
faith, and in other essential respects are
modelled deliberately on the English public
schools.</p>

<p>The strongest argument for sending a boy to
one of these schools is the fresh-air plea. Undeniably,
the growing boy in a large city is at a disadvantage.
He can rarely, if ever, obtain opportunities
for healthful exercise and recreation
equal to those afforded by a well-conducted
boarding-school. He is likely to become a little
man too early, or else to sit in the house because
there is nowhere to play. At a boarding-school
he will, under firm but gentle discipline, keep
regular hours, eat simple food, and between study
times be stimulated to cultivate athletic or other
outdoor pursuits. It is not strange that parents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
should be attracted by the comparison, and decide
that, on the whole, their boys will fare better
away from home. Obviously the aristocratic
mother will point out to her husband that his
predilection for the public school system is answered
by the fact that the State does not supply
schools away from the city, where abundant fresh
air and a famous foot-ball field are appurtenant
to the institution. Tom Brown at Rugby recurs
to them both, and they conclude that what has
been good enough for generations of English
boys will be best for their own son and heir.</p>

<p>On the other hand, have we Americans ever
quite reconciled ourselves to, and sympathized
with, the traditional attitude of English parents
toward their sons as portrayed in veracious fiction?
The day of parting comes; the mother,
red-eyed from secret weeping, tries not to break
down; the blubbering sisters throw their arms
around the neck of the hero of the hour, and slip
pen-wipers of their own precious making into
his pockets; the father, abnormally stern to hide
his emotion, says, bluffly, “Good-by, Tom; it’s
time to be off, and we’ll see you again at Christmas.”
And out goes Tom, a tender fledgeling,
into the great world of the public school, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
that is the last of home. His holidays arrive, but
there is no more weeping. He is practically out
of his parents’ lives, and the sweet influence of
a good mother is exercised only through fairly
regular correspondence. And Tom is said to be
getting manly, and that the nonsense has nearly
been knocked out of him. He has been bullied
and has learned to bully; he has been a fag and
is now a cock. Perhaps he is first scholar, if not
a hero of the cricket or foot-ball field. Then off
he goes to college, half a stranger to those who
love him best.</p>

<p>This is fine and manly perhaps, in the Anglo-Saxon
sense, but does it not seem just a little
brutal? Are we well-to-do Americans prepared
to give up to others, however exemplary, the conduct
of our children’s lives? Granting that the
American private boarding-school is a delightful
institution, where bullying and fags and cocks are
not known, can it ever take the place of home, or
supply the stimulus to individual life which is
exercised by wise parental love and precept? Of
course, it is easier, in a certain sense, to send one’s
boy to a select boarding-school, where the conditions
are known to be highly satisfactory. It
shifts the responsibility on to other shoulders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
and yet leaves one who is not sensitive, in the
pleasing frame of mind that the very best thing
has been done for the young idea. In our busy
American life&mdash;more feverish than that of our
English kinsfolk whose institution we have copied&mdash;many
doubtless are induced to seek this solution
of a perplexing problem by the consciousness
of their own lack of efficiency, and their own lack
of leisure to provide a continuous home influence
superior or equal to what can be supplied by headmasters
and their assistants, who are both churchmen
and athletes. Many, too, especially fathers,
are firm believers in that other English doctrine,
that most boys need to have the nonsense knocked
out of them, and that the best means of accomplishing
this result is to cut them loose from their
mothers’ apron-strings.</p>

<p>It is to be borne in mind in this connection
that the great English public schools are a national
cult. That is, everybody above a certain
class sends his sons to one of them. On the other
hand, the private boarding-schools on this side
of the water, fashioned after them, have thus far
attracted the patronage of a very small element
of the population. It is their misfortune, rather
than their fault, that they are chiefly the resort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
of the sons of rich or fashionable people, and
consequently are the most conspicuously class
schools in the country. Doubtless the earnest
men who conduct most of them regret that this
is so, but it is one of the factors of the case which
the American parent with sons must face at present.
It may be that this is to be the type of
school which is to become predominant here, and
that, as in England, the nation will recognize it
as a national force, even though here, as there,
only the sons of the upper classes enjoy its advantages.
That will depend partly on the extent
to which we shall decide, as a society, to promote
further class education. At present these
schools are essentially private institutions. They
are small; they do not, like our American colleges,
offer scholarships, and thus invite the attendance
of ambitious students without means.
Moreover, they are almost universally conducted
on a sectarian basis, or with a sectarian leaning,
which is apt to proselytize, at least indirectly.</p>

<p>While those in charge of them indisputably
strive to inculcate every virtue, the well-to-do
American father must remember that his sons
will associate intimately there with many boys
whose parents belong to that frivolous class which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
is to-day chiefly absorbed in beautiful establishments,
elaborate cookery, and the wholly material
vanities of life, and are out of sympathy with,
or are indifferent to, the earnest temper and views
of that already large and intelligent portion of
the community, which views with horror the development
among us of an aristocracy of wealth,
which apes and is striving to outdo the heartless
inanities of the Old World. He must remember
that a taste for luxury and sensuous, material
aims, even though they be held in check by
youthful devotion to the rites of the church, will
prove no less disastrous, in the long run, to manhood
and patriotism, than the lack of fresh air
or a famous foot-ball field.</p>

<p>If, however, the American father chooses to
keep his sons at home, he is bound to do all he
can to overcome the physical disadvantages of
city life. Fresh air and suitable exercise can be
obtained in the suburbs of most cities by a little
energy and co-operation on the part of parents.
As an instance, in one or two of our leading cities,
clubs of twelve to fifteen boys are sent out three
or four afternoons a week under the charge of an
older youth&mdash;usually a college or other student&mdash;who,
without interfering with their liberty, supervises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
their sports, and sees that they are well
occupied. On days when the weather is unsuitable
for any kind of game, he will take them to museums,
manufactories, or other places of interest in
the vicinity. In this way some of the watchfulness
and discipline which are constantly operative
at a boarding-school, are exercised without
injury to home ties. There is no doubt that, unless
parents are vigilant and interest themselves
unremittingly in providing necessary physical
advantages, the boys in a crowded city are likely
to be less healthy and vigorous in body, and perhaps
in mind, than those educated at a first-class
boarding-school. It may be, as our cities increase
in size, and suburbs become more difficult of access,
that the boarding-school will become more
generally popular; but there is reason to believe
that, before it is recognized as a national institution,
sectarian religion will have ceased to control
it, and it will be less imitative of England in its
tone and social attitude. Until then, at least, many
a parent will prefer to keep his boys at home.</p>

<p class="dropcap">“Supposing you had four daughters,
like Mr. Perkins, what would
you do with them, educationally
speaking?” I said to my wife Barbara,
by way of turning my attention to the
other sex.</p>

<p>“You mean what would they do with me?
They would drive me into my grave, I think,”
she answered. “Woman’s horizon has become
so enlarged that no mother can tell what her
next daughter may not wish to do. I understand,
though, that you are referring simply to schools.
To begin with, I take for granted you will agree
that American parents, who insist on sending
their boys to a public school, very often hesitate
or decline point-blank to send their girls.”</p>

<p>“Precisely. And we are forthwith confronted
by the question whether they are justified in so
doing.”</p>

<p>Barbara looked meditative for a moment, then
she said: “I am quite aware there is no logical
reason why girls should not be treated in the same
way, and yet as a matter of fact I am not at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
sure, patriotism and logic to the contrary notwithstanding,
I should send a daughter to a public
school unless I were convinced, from personal
examination, that she would have neither a vulgar
teacher nor vulgar associates. Manners mean
so much to a woman, and by manners I refer
chiefly to those nice perceptions of everything
which stamp a lady, and which you can no more
describe than you can describe the perfume of
the violet. The objection to the public schools
for a girl is that the unwritten constitution of this
country declared years ago that every woman was
a born lady, and that manners and nice perceptions
were in the national blood, and required no
cultivation for their production. Latterly, a good
many people interested in educational matters
have discovered the fallacy of this point of view;
so that when the name of a woman to act as the
head of a college or other first-class institution
for girls is brought forward to-day, the first question
asked is, ‘Is she a lady?’ Ten years ago
mental acquirements would have been regarded
as sufficient, and the questioner silenced with the
severe answer that every American woman is a
lady. The public school authorities are still harping
too much on the original fallacy, or rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the new point of view has not spread sufficiently
to cause the average American school-teacher to
suspect that her manners might be improved and
her sensibilities refined. There, that sounds like
treason to the principles of democracy, yet you
know I am at heart a patriot.”</p>

<p>“And yet to bring up boys on a common basis
and separate the girls by class education seems
like a contradiction of terms,” I said.</p>

<p>“I am confident&mdash;at least if we as a nation
really do believe in obliterating class distinctions&mdash;that
it won’t be long before those who control
the public schools recognize more universally the
value of manners, and of the other traits which
distinguish the woman of breeding from the woman
who has none,” said Barbara. “When that
time comes the well-to-do American mother will
have no more reason for not sending her daughters
to a public school than her sons. As it is,
they should send them oftener than they do.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” continued Barbara, presently,
“the best private schools are in the East, and a
very much larger percentage, both of girls and
boys, attends the public schools in the West than
in the East. Indeed, I am inclined to think that
comparatively few people west of Chicago do not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
send their children to public schools. But, on the
other hand, there are boarding-schools for girls
all over the East which are mainly supported by
girls from the West, whose mothers wish to have
them finished. They go to the public schools at
home until they are thirteen or fourteen, and then
are packed off to school for three or four years in
order to teach them how to move, and wear their
hair, and spell, and control their voices&mdash;for the
proper modulation of the voice has at last been
recognized as a necessary attribute of the well-bred
American woman. As for the Eastern girl
who is not sent to the public school, she usually
attends a private day-school in her native city, the
resources of which are supplemented by special
instruction of various kinds, in order to produce
the same finished specimen. But it isn’t the finished
specimen who is really interesting from the
educational point of view to-day; that is, the conventional,
cosmopolitan, finished specimen such
as is turned out with deportment and accomplishments
from the hands of the English governess,
the French Mother Superior, or the American
private school-mistress.</p>

<p>“After making due allowance for the national
point of view, I don’t see very much difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
in principle between the means adopted to finish
the young lady of society here and elsewhere.
There are thousands of daughters of well-to-do
mothers in this country who are brought up on
the old aristocratic theory that a woman should
study moderately hard until she is eighteen, then
look as pretty as she can, and devote herself until
she is married to having what is called on this
side of the Atlantic a good time. To be sure, in
France the good time does not come until after
marriage, and there are other differences, but the
well-bred lady of social graces is the well-bred
lady, whether it be in London, Paris, Vienna, or
New York, and a ball-room in one capital is essentially
the same as in all the others, unless it
be that over here the very young people are allowed
to crowd out everybody else. There are
thousands of mothers who are content that this
should be the limit of their daughter’s experience,
a reasonably good education and perfect
manners, four years of whirl, and then a husband,
or no husband and a conservative afternoon tea-drinking
spinsterhood&mdash;and they are thankful
on the whole when their girls put their necks
meekly beneath the yoke of convention and do
as past generations of women all over the civilized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
world have done. For the reign of the unconventional
society young woman is over. She
shocks now her own countrywoman even more
than foreigners; and though, like the buffalo, she
is still extant, she is disappearing even more rapidly
than that illustrious quadruped.”</p>

<p>“Are you not wandering slightly from the
topic?” I ventured to inquire.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” said Barbara. “I was stating
merely that the Old-World, New-World young
lady, with all her originality and piquancy, however
charming, and however delightfully inevitable
she may be, is not interesting from the educational
point of view. Or rather I will put it in
this way: the thoughtful, well-to-do American
mother is wondering hard whether she has a
right to be content with the ancient programme
for her daughters, and is watching with eager interest
the experiments which some of her neighbors
are trying with theirs. We cannot claim as
an exclusive national invention collegiate education
for women, and there’s no doubt that my
sex in England is no less completely on the war-path
than the female world here; but is there a
question that the peculiar qualities of American
womanhood are largely responsible for the awakening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
wherever it has taken place? My dear, you
asked me just now what a man like Mr. Perkins
should do with his four daughters. Probably
Mrs. Perkins is trying to make up her mind
whether she ought to send them to college. Very
likely she is arguing with Mr. Perkins as to
whether, all things considered, it wouldn’t be
advisable to have one or two of them study a
profession, or learn to do something bread-winning,
so that in case he, poor man&mdash;for he <em>does</em>
look overworked&mdash;should not succeed in leaving
them the five thousand dollars a year he
hopes, they need not swell the category of the
decayed gentlewoman of the day. I dare say they
discuss the subject assiduously, in spite of the
views Mr. Perkins has expressed to you regarding
the sacredness of unemployed feminine gentility;
for it costs so much to live that he can’t
lay up a great deal, and there are certainly strong
arguments in favor of giving such girls the opportunity
to make the most of themselves, or
at least to look at life from the self-supporting
point of view. At first, of course, the students
at the colleges for women were chiefly girls who
hoped to utilize, as workers in various lines, the
higher knowledge they acquired there; but every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
year sees more and more girls, who expect to be
married sooner or later&mdash;the daughters of lawyers,
physicians, merchants&mdash;apply for admission,
on the theory that what is requisite for a
man is none too good for them; and it is the example
of these girls which is agitating the serenity
of so many mothers, and suggesting to so
many daughters the idea of doing likewise. Even
the ranks of the most fashionable are being invaded,
though undeniably it is still the fashion
to stay at home, and I am inclined to think that
it is only the lack of the seal of fashion that restrains
many conservative people, like the Perkinses,
from educating their daughters as though
they probably would not be married, instead of
as though they were almost certain to be.”</p>

<p>“You may remember that Perkins assured me
not long ago, that marriage did not run in the
Perkins female line,” said I.</p>

<p>“All the more reason, then, that his girls should
be encouraged to equip themselves thoroughly in
some direction or other, instead of waiting disconsolately
to be chosen in marriage, keeping up
their courage as the years slip away, with a few
cold drops of Associated Charity. Of course the
majority of us will continue to be wives and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
mothers&mdash;there is nothing equal to that when
it is a success&mdash;but will not marriage become
still more desirable if the choicest girls are educated
to be the intellectual companions of men,
and taught to familiarize themselves with the real
conditions of life, instead of being limited to the
rose garden of a harem, over the hedges of which
they are expected only to peep at the busy world&mdash;the
world of men, the world of action and toil
and struggle and sin&mdash;the world into which
their sons are graduated when cut loose from the
maternal apron-strings? We intend to learn
what to teach our sons, so that we may no longer
be silenced with the plea that women do not
know, and be put off with a secretive conjugal
smile. And as for the girls who do not marry,
the world is open to them&mdash;the world of art and
song and charity and healing and brave endeavor
in a hundred fields. Become just like men?
Never. If there is one thing which the educated
woman of the present is seeking to preserve and
foster, it is the subtle delicacy of nature, it is the
engaging charm of womanhood which distinguishes
us from men. Who are the pupils at the
colleges for women to-day? The dowdy, sexless,
unattractive, masculine-minded beings who have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
served to typify for nine men out of ten the
crowning joke of the age&mdash;the emancipation of
women? No; but lovely, graceful, sympathetic,
earnest, pure-minded girls in the flower of attractive
maidenhood. And that is why the well-to-do
American mother is asking herself whether
she would be doing the best thing for her daughter
if she were to encourage her to become merely
a New-World, Old-World young lady of the ancient
order of things. For centuries the women
of civilization have worshipped chastity, suffering
resignation and elegance as the ideals of femininity;
now we mean to be intelligent besides, or
at least as nearly so as possible.”</p>

<p>“In truth a philippic, Barbara,” I said. “It
would seem as though Mrs. Grundy would not
be able to hold out much longer. Will you tell
me, by the way, what you women intend to do
after you are fully emancipated?”</p>

<p>“One thing at a time,” she answered. “We
have been talking of education, and I have simply
been suggesting that no conscientious mother can
afford to ignore or pass by with scorn the claims
of higher education for girls&mdash;experimental and
faulty as many of the present methods to attain
it doubtless are. As to what women are going to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
do when our preliminary perplexities are solved
and our sails are set before a favorable wind, I
have my ideas on that score also, and some day
I will discuss them with you. But just now I
should like you to answer <em>me</em> a question. What
are the best occupations for sons to follow when
they have left school or college?”</p>

<p>Pertinent and interesting as was this inquiry
of Barbara’s, I felt the necessity of drawing a
long breath before I answered it.</p>

<h2><i>Occupation.</i></h2>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t-1.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The American young man, in the
selection of a vocation, is practically
cut off from two callings
which are dear to his contemporaries
in other civilized countries&mdash;the
Army and the Navy. The possibility of war,
with all its horrors and its opportunities for personal
renown, is always looming up before the
English, French, German, or Russian youth,
who is well content to live a life of gilded martial
inactivity in the hope of sooner or later winning
the cross for conspicuous service, if he escapes a
soldier’s grave. We have endured one war, and
we profoundly hope never to undergo another.
Those of us who are ethically opposed to the
slaughter of thousands of human beings in a
single day by cannon, feel that we have geography
on our side. Even the bloodthirsty are forced
to acknowledge that the prospects here for a genuine
contest of any kind are not favorable. Consequently,
the ardor of the son and heir, who
would like to be a great soldier or a sea captain,
is very apt to be cooled by the representation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
that his days would be spent in watching Indians
or cattle thieves on the Western plains, or in
cruising uneventfully in the Mediterranean or
the Gulf of Mexico. At all events our standing,
or, more accurately speaking, sitting Army, and
our Navy are so small, that the demand for generals
and captains is very limited. Therefore,
though we commend to our sons the prowess of
Cæsar, Napoleon, Nelson, Von Moltke, and
Grant, we are able to demonstrate to them,
even without recourse to modern ethical arguments,
that the opportunities for distinction
on this side of the water are likely to be very
meagre.</p>

<p>Also, we Americans, unlike English parents,
hesitate to hold out as offerings to the Church a
younger son in every large family. We have no
national Church; moreover, the calling of a clergyman
in this country lacks the social picturesqueness
which goes far, or did go far, to reconcile
the British younger son to accept the living
which fell to his lot through family influence.
Then again, would the American mother, like
the conventional mother of the older civilizations,
as represented in biography and fiction,
if asked which of all vocations she would prefer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
to have her son adopt, reply promptly and fervidly,
“the ministry?”</p>

<p>I put this question to my wife by way of obtaining
an answer. She reflected a moment, then
she said, “If one of my boys really felt called
to be a clergyman, I should be a very happy
woman; but I wouldn’t on any account have
one of them enter the ministry unless he did.”
This reply seems to me to express not merely
the attitude of the American mother, but also
the point of view from which the American
young man of to-day is apt to look at the question.
He no longer regards the ministry as a profession
which he is free to prefer, merely because
he needs to earn his daily bread; and he understands,
when he becomes a clergyman, that lukewarm
or merely conventional service will be utterly
worthless in a community which is thirsty
for inspirational suggestion, but which is soul-sick
of cant and the perfervid reiteration of outworn
delusions. The consciousness that he has
no closer insight into the mysteries of the universe
than his fellow-men, and the fear that he
may be able to solace their doubts only by skilful
concealment of his own, is tending, here and
all over the civilized world, to deter many a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
young man from embracing that profession,
which once seemed to offer a safe and legitimate
niche for any pious youth who was uncertain
what he wished to do for a living. Happy he who
feels so closely in touch with the infinite that he
is certain of his mission to his brother-man! But
is any one more out of place than the priest who
seems to know no more than we do of what we
desire to know most? We demand that a poet
should be heaven-born; why should we not require
equivalent evidence of fitness from our
spiritual advisers?</p>

<p>And yet, on the other hand, when the conviction
of fitness or mission exists, what calling
is there which offers to-day more opportunities
for usefulness than the ministry? The growing
tendency of the Church is toward wider issues
and a broader scope. Clergymen are now encouraged
and expected to aid in the solution of problems
of living no less than those of dying, and to
lead in the discussion of matters regarding which
they could not have ventured to express opinions
fifty years ago without exposing themselves
to the charge of being meddlesome or unclerical.
The whole field of practical charity, economics,
hygiene, and the relations of human beings to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
each other on this earth, are fast becoming
the legitimate domain of the Church, and
the general interest in this new phase of usefulness
is serving to convince many of the
clergy themselves that the existence of so
many creeds, differing but slightly and unimportantly
from one another, is a waste of vital
force and machinery. In this age of trusts, a
trust of all religious denominations for the
common good of humanity would be a monopoly
which could pay large dividends without
fear of hostile legislation.</p>

<p>In this matter of the choice of a vocation, the
case of the ambitious, promising young man is
the one which commends itself most to our sympathies;
and next to it stands that of the general
utility man&mdash;the youth who has no definite
tastes or talents, and who selects his life occupation
from considerations other than a consciousness
of fitness or of natural inclination.
There are here, as elsewhere, born merchants,
lawyers, doctors, clergymen, architects, engineers,
inventors, and poets, who promptly follow their
natural bents without suggestion and in the teeth
of difficulties. But the promising young man in
search of a brilliant career, and the general utility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
man, are perhaps the best exponents of a nation’s
temper and inclination.</p>

<p>In every civilization many promising youths
and the general run of utility men are apt to turn
to business, for trade seems to offer the largest
return in the way of money with the least amount
of special knowledge. In this new country of ours
the number of young men who have selected a
business career during the last fifty years, from
personal inclination, has been very much greater
than elsewhere, and the tone and temper of the
community has swept the general utility man
into mere money making almost as a matter of
course. The reasons for this up to this time have
been obvious: The resources and industries of a
vast and comparatively sparsely settled continent
have been developed in the last fifty years, and
the great prizes in the shape of large fortunes resulting
from the process have naturally captivated
the imagination of ambitious youth. We
have unjustly been styled a nation of shopkeepers;
but it may in all fairness be alleged that, until
the last fifteen years, we have been under the
spell of the commercial and industrial spirit, and
that the intellectual faculties of the nation have
been mainly absorbed in the introduction and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
maintenance of railroads and factories, in the raising
and marketing of grain, in the development
of real estate enterprises, and in trading in the
commodities or securities which these various
undertakings have produced.</p>

<p>The resources of the country are by no means
exhausted; there are doubtless more mines to
open which will make their owners superbly rich;
new discoveries in the mechanical or electrical
field will afford fresh opportunities to discerning
men of means; and individual or combined capital
will continue to reap the reward of both legitimate
and over-reaching commercial acumen.
But it would seem as though the day of enormous
fortunes, for men of average brains and
luck, in this country were nearly over, and that
the great pecuniary prizes of the business world
would henceforth be gleaned only by extraordinary
or exceptional individuals. The country
is no longer sparsely settled; fierce competition
speedily cuts the abnormal profit out of new enterprises
which are not protected by a patent;
and in order to be conspicuously successful in
any branch of trade, one will have more and more
need of unusual ability and untiring application.</p>

<p>In other words, though ours is still a new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
country, it will not be very long before the opportunities
and conditions of a business life resemble
closely those which confront young men
elsewhere. As in every civilized country, trade
in some form will necessarily engage the attention
of a large portion of the population. From
physical causes, a vast majority of the citizens
of the United States must continue to derive
their support from agriculture and the callings
which large crops of cereals, cotton, and sugar
make occasion for. Consequently business will
always furnish occupation for a vast army of
young men in every generation, and few successes
will seem more enviable than those of the
powerful and scrupulous banker, or the broad-minded
and capable railroad president. But, on
the other hand, will the well-to-do American
father and mother, eager to see their promising
sons make the most of themselves, continue to
advise them to go into business in preference to
other callings? And will the general utility man
still be encouraged to regard some form of trade
as the most promising outlook, for one who
does not know what he wishes to do, to adopt?
He who hopes to become a great banker or
illustrious railway man, must remember that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
streets of all our large cities teem with young
men whose breasts harbor similar ambitions.</p>

<p>Doubtless, it was the expectation of our forefathers
that our American civilization would add
new occupations to the callings inherited from
the old world, which would be alluring both to
the promising young man and the youth without
predilections, and no less valuable to society and
elevating to the individual than the best of those
by which men have earned their daily bread since
civilization first was. As a matter of fact, we
Americans have added just one, that of the modern
stock-broker. To be sure, I am not including
the ranchman. It did seem at one time as
though we were going to add another in him&mdash;a
sort of gentleman shepherd. But be it that the
cattle have become too scarce or too numerous,
be it that the demon of competition has planted
his hoofs on the farthest prairie, one by one the
brave youths who went West in search of fortune,
have returned East for the last time, and
abandoned the field to the cowboys and the native
settler. The pioneers in this form of occupation
made snug fortunes, but after them came
a deluge of promising or unpromising youths
who branded every animal within a radius of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
hundreds of miles with a letter of the alphabet.
Their only living monument is the polo pony.</p>

<p>Our single and signal contribution to the callings
of the world has been the apotheosis of the
stock-broker. For the last twenty-five years, the
well-to-do father and mother and their sons, in
our large cities, have been under the spell of a
craze for the brokerage business. The consciousness
that the refinements of modern living cannot
adequately be supplied in a large city to a
family whose income does not approximate ten
thousand dollars a year, is a cogent argument in
favor of trying to grow rich rapidly, and both
the promising young man and the general utility
man welcomed the new calling with open arms.
Impelled by the notion that here was a vocation
which required no special knowledge or attainments,
and very little capital, which was pleasant,
gentlemanly, and not unduly confining, and
which promised large returns almost in the
twinkling of an eye, hundreds and thousands
of young men became brokers&mdash;chiefly stock-brokers,
but also cotton-brokers, note-brokers,
real-estate-brokers, insurance-brokers, and
brokers in nearly everything. The field was
undoubtedly a rich one for those who first entered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
it. There was a need for the broker, and
he was speedily recognized as a valuable addition
to the machinery of trade. Many huge fortunes
were made, and we have learned to associate the
word broker with the possession of large means,
an imposing house on a fashionable street, and
diverse docked and stylish horses.</p>

<p>Of course, the king of all brokers has been the
stock-broker, for to him was given the opportunity
to buy and sell securities on his own account,
though he held himself out to his customers
as merely a poor thing who worked for
a commission. No wonder that the young man,
just out of college, listened open-mouthed to the
tales of how many thousands of dollars a year
so and so, who had been graduated only five
years before, was making, and resolved to try his
luck with the same Aladdin’s lamp. Nor was it
strange that the sight of men scarcely out of
their teens, driving down town in fur coats, in
their own equipages, with the benison of successful
capitalists in their salutations, settled the
question of choice for the youth who was wavering
or did not know what he wished to do.</p>

<p>It is scarcely an extreme statement that the so-called
aristocracy of our principal cities to-day is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
largely made up of men who are, or once were,
stock-brokers, or who have made their millions
by some of the forms of gambling which our
easy-going euphemism styles modern commercial
aggressiveness. Certainly, a very considerable
number of our most splendid private residences
have been built out of the proceeds of
successful ventures in the stock market, or the
wheat pit, or by some other purely speculative
operations. Many stars have shone brilliantly for
a season, and then plunged precipitately from the
zenith to the horizon; and much has been wisely
said as to the dangers of speculation; but the fact
remains that a great many vast fortunes owe their
existence to the broker’s office; fortunes which
have been salted down, as the phrase is, and now
furnish support and titillation for a leisurely,
green old age, or enable the sons and daughters
of the original maker to live in luxury.</p>

<p>Whatever the American mother may feel as to
her son becoming a clergyman, there is no doubt
that many a mother to-day would say “God
grant that no son of mine become a stock-broker.”
I know stock-brokers&mdash;many indeed&mdash;who
are whole-souled, noble-natured men,
free from undue worldliness, and with refined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
instincts. But the stock-broker, as he exists in
the every-day life of our community, typifies
signally the gambler’s yearning to gain wealth
by short cuts, and the monomania which regards
as pitiable those who do not possess and display
the gewgaws of feverish, fashionable materialism.
There are stock-brokers in all the great capitals
of the world, but nowhere has the vocation swallowed
up the sons of the best people to the extent
that it has done here during the last thirty
years. And yet, apart from the opportunity it
affords to grow rich rapidly, what one good reason
is there why a promising young man should
decide to buy and sell stocks for a living? Indeed,
not merely decide, but select, that occupation
as the most desirable calling open to him?
Does it tend either to ennoble the nature or enrich
the mental faculties? It is one of the formal
occupations made necessary by the exigencies of
the business world, and as such is legitimate and
may be highly respectable; but surely it does
not, from the nature of the services required,
deserve to rank high; and really there would
seem to be almost as much occasion for conferring
the accolade of social distinction on a dealer
in excellent fish as on a successful stock-broker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>However, alas! it is easy enough to assign the
reason why the business has been so popular. It
appears that, even under the flag of our aspiring
nationality, human nature is still so weak that
the opportunity to grow rich quickly, when presented,
is apt to over-ride all noble considerations.
Foreign censors have ventured not infrequently
to declare that there was never yet a race so hungry
for money as we free-born Americans; and
not even the pious ejaculation of one of our
United States Senators, “What have we to do
with abroad?” is conclusive proof that the accusation
is not well founded. In fact: there seems
to be ample proof that we, who sneered so austerely
at the Faubourg St. Germain and the aristocracies
of the Old World, and made Fourth
of July protestations of poverty and chastity,
have fallen down and worshipped the golden calf
merely because it was made of gold. Because it
seemed to be easier to make money as stock-brokers
than in any other way, men have hastened
to become stock-brokers. To be sure it
may be answered that this is only human nature
and the way of the world. True, perhaps; except
that we started on the assumption that we were
going to improve on the rest of the world, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
that its human nature was not to be our human
nature. Would not the Faubourg St. Germain
be preferable to an aristocracy of stock-brokers?</p>

<p>At all events, the law of supply and demand
is beginning to redeem the situation, and, if not
to restore our moral credit, at least to save the rising
generation from falling into the same slough.
The stock-broker industry has been overstocked,
and the late young capitalists in fur overcoats,
with benedictory manners, wear anxious countenances
under the stress of that Old World demon,
excessive competition. Youth can no longer
wake up in the morning and find itself the proprietor
of a rattling business justifying a steam-yacht
and a four-in-hand. The good old days
have gone forever, and there is weeping and
gnashing of teeth where of late there was joy
and much accumulation. There is not business
enough for all the promising young men who
are stock-brokers already, and the youth of promise
must turn elsewhere.</p>

<p class="dropcap">But though the occupation of broker
has become less tempting, the promising
youth has not ceased to look
askance at any calling which does not
seem to foreshadow a fortune in a short time.
He is only just beginning to appreciate that we
are getting down to hard pan, so to speak, and
are nearly on a level, as regards the hardships of
individual progress, with our old friends the effete
civilizations. He finds it difficult to rid himself
of the “Arabian Nights’” notion that he has
merely to clap his hands to change ten dollars
into a thousand in a single year, and to transform
his bachelor apartments into a palace beautiful,
with a wife, yacht, and horses, before he is
thirty-five. He shrinks from the idea of being
obliged to take seriously into account anything
less than a hundred-dollar bill, and of earning a
livelihood by slow yet persistent acceptance of
tens and fives. His present ruling ambition is to
be a promoter; that is, to be an organizer of
schemes, and to let others do the real work and
attend to the disgusting details. There are a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
many gentry of this kind in the field just at present.
Among them is, or rather was, Lewis Pell,
as I will call him for the occasion. I don’t know
exactly what he is doing now. But he was, until
lately, a promoter.</p>

<p>A handsome fellow was Lewis Pell. Tall, gentlemanly,
and athletic-looking, with a gracious,
imposing presence and manner, which made his
rather commonplace conversation seem almost
wisdom. He went into a broker’s office after leaving
college, like many other promising young
men of his time, but he was clever enough either
to realize that he was a little late, or that the promoter
business offered a more promising scope
for his genius, for he soon disappeared from the
purlieus of the Stock Exchange, and the next
thing we heard of him was as the tenant of an
exceedingly elaborate set of offices on the third
floor of a most expensive modern monster building.
Shortly after I read in the financial columns
of the daily press that Mr. Lewis Pell had sold
to a syndicate of bankers the first mortgage and
the debenture bonds of the Light and Power
Traction Company, an electrical corporation organized
under the laws of the State of New Jersey.
Thirty days later I saw again that he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
sailed for Europe in order to interest London
capital in a large enterprise, the nature of which
was still withheld from the public.</p>

<p>During the next two or three years I ran across
Pell on several occasions. He seemed always to
be living at the highest pressure, but the brilliancy
of his career had not impaired his good
manners or attractiveness. I refer to his career
as brilliant at this time because both his operations
and the consequent style of living which
he pursued, as described by him on two different
evenings when I dined with him, seemed to me in
my capacity of ordinary citizen to savor of the
marvellous, if not the supernatural. He frankly
gave me to understand that it seemed to him a
waste of time for an ambitious man to pay attention
to details, and that his business was to originate
vast undertakings, made possible only by
large combinations of corporate or private capital.
The word combination, which was frequently on
his lips, seemed to be the corner-stone of his system.
I gathered that the part which he sought to
play in the battle of life was to breathe the breath,
or the apparent breath, of existence into huge
schemes, and after having given them a quick
but comprehensive squeeze or two for his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
pecuniary benefit, to hand them over to syndicates,
or other aggregations of capitalists, for the
benefit of whom they might concern. He confided
to me that he employed eleven typewriters;
that he had visited London seven, and Paris three
times, in the last three years, on flying trips to
accomplish brilliant deals; that though his headquarters
were in New York, scarcely a week passed
in which he was not obliged to run over to Chicago,
Boston, Washington, Denver, Duluth, or
Cincinnati, as the case might be. Without being
boastful as to his profits, he did not hesitate to
acknowledge to me that if he should do as well
in the next three years as in the last, he would
be able to retire from business with a million
or so.</p>

<p>Apart from this confession, his personal extravagance
left no room for doubt that he must
be very rich. Champagne flowed for him as Croton
or Cochituate for most of us, and it was evident
from his language that the hiring of special
trains from time to time was a rather less serious
matter than it would be for the ordinary citizen
to take a cab. The account that he gave of three
separate entertainments he had tendered to syndicates&mdash;of
ten, twelve, and seventeen covers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
respectively, at twenty dollars a cover&mdash;fairly
made my mouth water and my eyes stick out,
so that I felt constrained to murmur, “Your
profits must certainly be very large, if you can
afford that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>Pell smiled complacently and a little condescendingly.
“I could tell you of things which I
have done which would make that seem a bagatelle,”
he answered, with engaging mystery.
Then after a moment’s pause he said, “Do you
know, my dear fellow, that when I was graduated
I came very near going into the office of a
pious old uncle of mine who has been a commission
merchant all his life, and is as poor as Job’s
turkey in spite of it all&mdash;that is, poor as men are
rated nowadays. He offered to take me as a clerk
at one thousand dollars a year, with the promise
of a partnership before I was bald-headed in case
I did well. Supposing I had accepted his offer,
where should I be to-day? Grubbing at an office-desk
and earning barely enough for board
and lodging. I remember my dear mother took
it terribly to heart because I went into a broker’s
office instead. By the way, between ourselves,
I’m building a steam-yacht&mdash;nothing very wonderful,
but a neat, comfortable craft&mdash;and I’m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
looking forward next summer to inviting my
pious old uncle to cruise on her just to see him
open his eyes.”</p>

<p>That was three years ago, and to-day I have
every reason to believe that Lewis Pell is without
a dollar in the world, or rather, that every dollar
which he has belongs to his creditors. I had
heard before his failure was announced that he
was short of money, for the reason that several
enterprises with which his name was connected
had been left on his hands&mdash;neither the syndicates
nor the public would touch them&mdash;so his
suspension was scarcely a surprise. He at present,
poor fellow, is only one of an army of young
men wandering dejectedly through the streets
of New York or Chicago in these days of financial
depression, vainly seeking for something to
promote.</p>

<p>When the promising youth and the general
utility man do get rid of the “Arabian Nights’”
notion, and recognize that signal success here, in
any form, is likely to become more and more
difficult to attain, and will be the legitimate reward
only of men of real might, of unusual abilities,

the callings which have fallen, as it were, into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
disrepute through their lack of gambling facilities,
are likely to loom up again socially. It may
be, however, that modern business methods and
devices have had the effect of killing for all time
that highly respectable pillar of society of fifty
years ago, the old-fashioned merchant, who
bought and sold on his own behalf, or on commission,
real cargoes of merchandise, and real
consignments of cotton, wheat, and corn. The
telegraph and the warehouse certificate have
worked such havoc that almost everything now
is bought and sold over and over again before
it is grown or manufactured, and by the time it
is on the market there is not a shred of profit in
it for anybody but the retail dealer. It remains
to be seen whether, as the speculative spirit subsides,
the merchant is going to reinstate himself
and regain his former prestige. It may already
be said that the promising youth does not regard
him with quite so much contempt as he
did.</p>

<p>We have always professed in this country
great theoretical respect for the schoolmaster,
but we have been careful, as the nation waxed in
material prosperity, to keep his pay down and
to shove him into the social background more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
and more. The promising youth could not afford
to spend his manhood in this wise, and we
have all really been too busy making money to
think very much about those who are doing the
teaching. Have we not always heard it stated that
our schools and colleges are second to none in
the world? And if our schools, of course our
schoolmasters. Therefore why bother our heads
about them? It is indeed wonderful, considering
the little popular interest in the subject until
lately, that our schoolmasters and our college
professors are so competent as they are, and that
the profession has flourished on the whole in
spite of indifference and superiority. How can
men of the highest class be expected to devote
their lives to a profession which yields little more
than a pittance when one is thoroughly successful?
And yet the education of our children ought
to be one of our dearest concerns, and it is difficult
to see why the State is satisfied to pay the
average instructor or instructress of youth about
as much as the city laborer or a horse-car conductor
receives.</p>

<p>There are signs that those in charge of our
large educational institutions all over the country
are beginning to recognize that ripe scholarship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
and rare abilities as a teacher are entitled to
be well recompensed pecuniarily, and that the
breed of such men is likely to increase somewhat
in proportion to the size and number of the
prizes offered. Our college presidents and professors,
those at the head of our large schools
and seminaries, should receive such salaries as
will enable them to live adequately. By this
policy not only would our promising young men
be encouraged to pursue learning, but those in
the highest places would not be forced by poverty
to live in comparative retirement, but could
become active social figures and leaders. In any
profession or calling under present social conditions
only those in the foremost rank can hope
to earn more than a living, varying in quality
according to the degree of success and the rank
of the occupation; but it is to be hoped&mdash;and
there seems some reason to believe&mdash;that the
great rewards which come to those more able
and industrious than their fellows will henceforth,
in the process of our national evolution,
be more evenly distributed, and not confined so
conspicuously to gambling, speculative, or commercial
successes. The leaders in the great professions
of law and medicine have for some time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
past declined to serve the free-born community
without liberal compensation, and the same community,
which for half a century secretly believed
that only a business man has the right to grow
rich, has begun to recognize that there are even
other things besides litigation and health which
ought to come high. For instance, although the
trained architect still meets serious and depressing
competition from those ready-made experimenters
in design who pronounce the first <i>c</i> in
the word architect as though it were an <i>s</i>, the public
is rapidly discovering that a man cannot build
an attractive house without special knowledge.</p>

<p>In the same class with the law, medicine, and
architecture, and seemingly offering at present a
greater scope for an ambitious young man, is engineering
in all its branches. The furnaces, mines,
manufactories, and the hydraulic, electrical, or
other plants connected with the numerous vast
mechanical business enterprises of the country
are furnishing immediate occupation for hundreds
of graduates of the scientific or polytechnic
schools at highly respectable salaries. This field
of usefulness is certain for a long time to come to
offer employment and a fair livelihood to many,
and large returns to those who outstrip their contemporaries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
More and more is the business man,
the manufacturer, and the capitalist likely to be
dependent for the economical or successful development
and management of undertakings on
the judgment of scientific experts in his own employment
or called in to advise, and it is only
meet that the counsel given should be paid for
handsomely.</p>

<p>Those who pursue literature or art in their
various branches in this country, and have talents
in some degree commensurate with their
ambition, are now generally able to make a comfortable
livelihood. Indeed the men and women
in the very front rank are beginning to receive
incomes which would be highly satisfactory to a
leading lawyer or physician. Of course original
work in literature or art demands special ability
and fitness, but the general utility man is beginning
to have many opportunities presented to
him in connection with what may be called the
clerical work of these professions. The great
magazines and publishing houses have an increasing
need for trained, scholarly men, for capable
critics, and discerning advisers in the field
both of letter-press and illustration. Another
calling which seems to promise great possibilities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
both of usefulness and income to those who devote
themselves to it earnestly is the comparatively
new profession of journalism. The reporter,
with all his present horrors, is in the process
of evolution; but the journalist is sure to
remain the high-priest of democracy. His influence
is almost certain to increase materially, but
it will not increase unless he seeks to lead public
thought instead of bowing to it. The newspaper,
in order to flourish, must be a moulder of opinion,
and to accomplish this those who control its
columns must more and more be men of education,
force, and high ideals. Competition will
winnow here as elsewhere, but those who by ability
and industry win the chief places will stand
high in the community and command large pay
for their services.</p>

<p>An aristocracy of brains&mdash;that is to say, an
aristocracy composed of individuals successful
and prominent in their several callings&mdash;seems
to be the logical sequence of our institutions under
present social and industrial conditions. The
only aristocracy which can exist in a democracy
is one of honorable success evidenced by wealth
or a handsome income, but the character of such
an aristocracy will depend on the ambitions and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
tastes of the nation. The inevitable economic law
of supply and demand governs here as elsewhere,
and will govern until such a time as society may
be reconstructed on an entirely new basis. Only
the leaders in any vocation can hope to grow rich,
but in proportion as the demands of the nation
for what is best increase will the type and characteristics
of these leaders improve. The doing
away with inherited orders of nobility and deliberate,
patented class distinctions, gives the entire
field to wealth. We boast proudly that no artificial
barriers confine individual social promotion;
but we must remember at the same time
that those old barriers meant more than the perpetuation
of perfumed ladies and idle gentlemen
from century to century. We are too apt to forget
that the aristocracies of the old world signified
in the first place a process of selection. The
kings and the nobles, the lords and the barons,
the knights who fought and the ladies for whom
they died, were the master-spirits of their days
and generations, the strong arms and the strong
brains of civilized communities. They stood for
force, the force of the individual who was more
intelligent, more capable, and mightier in soul
and body than his neighbors, and who claimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
the prerogatives of superiority on that account.
These master-spirits, it is true, used these prerogatives
in such a manner as to crystallize society
into the classes and the masses, so hopelessly
for the latter that the gulf between them still is
wide as an ocean, notwithstanding that present
nobilities have been shorn of their power so that
they may be said to exist chiefly by sufferance.
And yet the world is still the same in that there
are men more intelligent, more capable, and
mightier in soul and body than their fellows.
The leaders of the past won their spurs by prowess
with the battle-axe and spear, by wise counsel
in affairs of state, by the sheer force of their
superior manhood. The gentleman and lady
stood for the best blood of the world, though
they so often belied it by their actions.</p>

<p>We, who are accustomed to applaud our civilization
as the hope of the world, may well look
across the water and take suggestions from the
institutions of Great Britain, not with the idea of
imitation, but with a view to consider the forces
at work there. For nearly a century now the government,
though in form a monarchy, has been
substantially a constitutional republic, imbued
with inherited traditions and somewhat galvanized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
by class distinctions, but nevertheless a constitutional
republic. The nobility still exists as a
sort of French roof or Eastern pagoda to give
a pleasing appearance to the social edifice. The
hereditary meaning of titles has been so largely
negatived by the introduction of new blood&mdash;the
blood of the strongest men of the period&mdash;that
they have become, what they originally
were, badges to distinguish the men most valuable
to the State. Their abolition is merely a
question of time, and many of the leaders to
whom they are proffered reject them as they
would a cockade or a yellow satin waistcoat. On
the other hand, and here is the point of argument,
the real aristocracy of England for the last
hundred years has been an aristocracy of the
foremost, ablest, and worthiest men of the nation,
and with few exceptions the social and
pecuniary rewards have been bestowed both by
the State and by public appreciation on the master-spirits
of the time in the best sense. Brilliant
statesmanship, wisdom on the bench, the surgeon’s
skill, the banker’s sound discernment,
genius in literature and art, when signally contributed
by the individual, have won him fame
and fortune.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>It may be said, perhaps, that the pecuniary
rewards of science and literature have been less
conspicuous than those accorded to other successes,
but that has been due to the inherent
practical temperament and artistic limitations of
the Englishman, and can scarcely be an argument
against the contention that English society
in the nineteenth century, with all its social idiosyncrasies,
has really been graded on the order
of merit.</p>

<p>The tide of democracy has set in across the
water and is running strongly, and there can be
no doubt that the next century is likely to work
great and strange changes in the conditions of
society in England as well as here. The same
questions practically are presented to each nation,
except that there a carefully constructed and in
many respects admirable system of society is to
be disintegrated. We are a new country, and we
have a right to be hopeful that we are sooner or
later to outstrip all civilizations. Nor is it a blemish
that the astonishing development of our material
resources has absorbed the energies of our
best blood. But it now remains to be seen whether
the standards of pure democracy, without traditions
or barriers to point the way, are to justify<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the experiment and improve the race. The character
of our aristocracy will depend on the virtues
and tastes of the people, and the struggle
is to be between aspiration and contentment with
low ambitions. Our original undertaking has been
made far more difficult by the infusion of the
worst blood in Christendom, the lees of foreign
nations; but the result of the experiment will be
much more convincing because of this change in
conditions.</p>

<p>Who are to be the men of might and heroes
of democracy? That will depend on the demands
and aspirations of the enfranchised people. With
all its imperfections, the civilization of the past
has fostered the noble arts and stirred genius to
immortalize itself in bronze and marble, in cathedral
spires, in masterpieces of painting and literature,
in untiring scholarship, in fervent labors in
law, medicine, and science. Democracy must care
for these things, and encourage the individual to
choose worthy occupations, or society will suffer.
We hope and believe that, in the long run, the
standards of humanity will be raised rather than
lowered by the lifting of the flood-gates which
divide the privileged classes from the mass; but
it behooves us all to remember that while demand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
and supply must be the leading arbiters
in the choice of a vocation, the responsibility of
selection is left to each individual. Only by the
example of individuals will society be saved from
accepting the low, vulgar aims and ambitions of
the mass as a desirable weal, and this is the
strongest argument against the doctrines of those
who would repress individuality for the alleged
benefit of mankind as a whole. The past has
given us many examples of the legislator who
cannot be bribed, of the statesman faithful to
principle, of the student who disdains to be superficial,
of the gentleman who is noble in
thought, and speech and action, and they stand
on the roll of the world’s great men. Democracy
cannot afford not to continue to add to this list,
and either she must steel her countenance against
the cheap man and his works, or sooner or later
be confounded. Was Marie Antoinette a more
dangerous enemy of the people than the newspaper
proprietor who acquires fortune by catering
to the lowest tastes and prejudices of the
public, or the self-made capitalist who argues
that every man has his price, and seeks to accomplish
legislation by bribery?</p>

<p class="dropcap">I brought Rogers home with
me again the other day. I do not
mean Rogers in the flesh; but
the example of Rogers as a bogy
with which to confound my better
half and myself. You may recall that Rogers
is the book-keeper for Patterson the banker,
and that he has brought up and educated a
family on a salary of twenty-two hundred dollars
a year.</p>

<p>“Barbara,” said I, “we were reflecting yesterday
that we never have time to do the things
we really wish to do. Have you ever considered
how Rogers spends his time?”</p>

<p>My wife admitted that she had not, and she
dutifully waited for me to proceed, though I
could tell from the expression of her mouth that
she did not expect to derive much assistance
from the example of Mr. Rogers. Therefore I
made an interesting pathological deduction to
begin with.</p>

<p>“Rogers does not live on his nerves from
one year’s end to the other, as we do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>“I congratulate him,” said Barbara, with a
sigh.</p>

<p>“And yet,” I continued, “he leads a highly
respectable and fairly interesting life. He gets up
at precisely the same hour every morning, has
his breakfast, reads the paper, and is at his desk
punctually on time. He dines frugally, returns
to his desk until half-past four or five, and after
performing any errands which Mrs. Rogers has
asked him to attend to, goes home to the bosom
of his family. There he exchanges his coat and
boots for a dressing-gown, or aged smoking-jacket,
and slippers, and remains by his fireside
absorbed in the evening paper until tea-time.
Conversation with the members of his family
beguiles him for half an hour after the completion
of the meal; then he settles down to the
family weekly magazine, or plays checkers or
backgammon with his wife or daughters. After
a while, if he is interested in ferns or grasses, he
looks to see how his specimens are growing under
the glass case in the corner. He pats the cat and
makes sure that the canary is supplied with seed.
Now and then he brings home a puzzle, like
‘Pigs in Clover,’ which keeps him up half an
hour later than usual, but ordinarily his head is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
nodding before the stroke of ten warns him that
his bed-hour has come. And just at the time
that the wife of his employer, Patterson, may be
setting out for a ball, he is tucking himself up
in bed by the side of Mrs. Rogers.”</p>

<p>“Poor man!” interjected Barbara.</p>

<p>“He has his diversions,” said I. “Now and
again neighbors drop in for a chat, and the evening
is wound up with a pitcher of lemonade and
angel-cake. He and his wife drop in, in their
turn, or he goes to a political caucus. Once a
fortnight comes the church sociable, and every
now and then a wedding. From time to time he
and Mrs. Rogers attend lectures. His young people
entertain their friends, as the occasion offers,
in a simple way, and on Sunday he goes to church
in the morning and falls to sleep after a heavy
dinner in the afternoon. He leads a quiet, peaceful,
conservative existence, unharassed by social
functions and perpetual excitement.”</p>

<p>“And he prides himself, I dare say,” said
Barbara, “on the score of its virtuousness. He
saves his nerves and he congratulates himself
that he is not a society person, as he calls it.
Your Mr. Rogers may be a very estimable individual,
dear, in his own sphere, and I do think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
he manages wonderfully on his twenty-two hundred
dollars a year; but I should prefer to see
you lose your nerves and become a gibbering
victim of nervous prostration rather than that
you should imitate him.”</p>

<p>“I’m not proposing to imitate him, Barbara,”
I answered, gravely. “I admit that his life seems
rather dull and not altogether inspiring, but I
do think that a little of his repose would be
beneficial to many of us whose interests are more
varied. We might borrow it to advantage for a
few months in the year, don’t you think so? I
believe, Barbara, that if you and I were each of
us to lie flat on our backs for one hour every
day and think of nothing&mdash;and not even clinch
our hands&mdash;we should succeed in doing more
things than we really wish to do.”</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s the climate&mdash;they say it’s
the climate,” said Barbara, pensively. “Foreigners
don’t seem to be affected in that way. They’re
not always in a hurry as we are, and yet they
seem to accomplish very nearly as much. We
all know what it is to be conscious of that dreadful,
nervous, hurried feeling, even when we have
plenty of time to do the things we have to do.
I catch myself walking fast&mdash;racing, in fact&mdash;when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
there is not the least need of it. I don’t
clinch my hands nearly so much as I used, and
I’ve ceased to hold on to the pillow in bed as
though it were a life-preserver, out of deference
to Delsarte, but when it comes to lying down
flat on my back for an hour a day&mdash;every day&mdash;really
it isn’t feasible. It’s an ideal plan, I
dare say, but the days are not long enough. Just
take to-day, for instance, and tell me, please,
when I had time to lie down.”</p>

<p>“You are clinching your hands now,” I remarked.</p>

<p>“Because you have irritated me with your
everlasting Mr. Rogers,” retorted Barbara. She
examined, nevertheless, somewhat dejectedly,
the marks of her nails in her palms. “In the
morning, for instance, when I came down to
breakfast there was the mail. Two dinner invitations
and an afternoon tea; two sets of wedding-cards,
and a notice of a lecture by Miss
Clara Hatheway on the relative condition of
primary schools here and abroad; requests for
subscriptions to the new Cancer Hospital and
the Children’s Fresh Air and Vacation Fund;
an advertisement of an after-holiday sale of boys’
and girls’ clothes at Halliday’s; a note from Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
James Green asking particulars regarding our
last cook, and a letter from the President of my
Woman’s Club notifying me that I was expected
to talk to them at the next meeting on the arguments
in favor of and against the ownership
by cities and towns of gas and water-works. All
these had to be answered, noted, or considered.
Then I had to interview the cook and the
butcher and the grocer about the dinner, give
orders that a button should be sewn on one pair
of your trousers and a stain removed from another,
and give directions to the chore-man to
oil the lock of the front-door, and tell him to go
post-haste for the plumber to extract the blotting-paper
which the children yesterday stuffed
down the drain-pipe in the bath-tub, so that the
water could not escape. Then I had to sit down
and read the newspaper. Not because I had time,
or wished to, but to make sure that there was
nothing in it which you could accuse me of not
having read. After this I dressed to go out. I
stopped at the florist’s to order some roses for
Mrs. Julius Cæsar, whose mother is dead; at
Hapgood &amp; Wales’s and at Jones’s for cotton-batting,
hooks and eyes, and three yards of ribbon;
at Belcher’s for an umbrella to replace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
mine, which you left in the cable-cars, and at
the library to select something to read. I arrived
home breathless for the children’s dinner, and
immediately afterward I dressed and went to the
meeting of the Executive Committee of the Woman’s
Club, stopping on the way to inquire if
Mrs. Wilson’s little boy were better. We started
by discussing a proposed change in our Constitution
regarding the number of black-balls necessary
to exclude a candidate, and drifted off on
to ‘Trilby.’ It was nearly five when I got away,
and as I felt it on my conscience to go both to
Mrs. Southwick’s and Mrs. Williams’s teas, I
made my appearance at each for a few minutes,
but managed to slip away so as to be at home
at six. When you came in I had just been reading
to the children and showing them about their
lessons. Now I have only just time to dress for
dinner, for we dine at the Gregory Browns, at
half-past seven. We ought to go later to the reception
at Mrs. Hollis’s&mdash;it is her last of three
and we haven’t been yet&mdash;but I suppose you
will say you are too tired. There! will you tell
me when I could have found time to lie down
for an hour to-day?”</p>

<p>I was constrained to laugh at my wife’s recital,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
and I was not able at the moment to point
out to her exactly what she might have omitted
from her category so as to make room for the
hour of repose. Nor, indeed, as I review the
events of my own daily life and of the daily lives
of my friends and acquaintances, am I able to
define precisely where it could be brought in.
And yet are we not&mdash;many of us who are in the
thick of modern life&mdash;conscious that our days
are, as it were, congested? We feel sure that so
far as our physical comfort is concerned we ought
to be doing less, and we shrewdly suspect that, if
we had more time in which to think, our spiritual
natures would be the gainers. The difficulty
is to stop, or rather to reduce the speed of modern
living to the point at which these high-pressure
nervous symptoms disappear, and the days
cease to seem too short for what we wish to
accomplish. Perhaps those who take an intense
interest in living will never be able to regain that
delightful condition of equipoise, if it ever existed,
which our ancestors both here and across
the water are said to have experienced. Perhaps,
too, our ancestors were more in a hurry when
they were alive than they seem to have been now
that they are dead; but, whether this be true or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
otherwise, we are confidently told by those who
ought to know that we Americans of this day and
generation are the most restless, nervous people
under the sun, and live at a higher pressure than
our contemporaries of the effete civilizations. It
used to be charged that we were in such haste to
grow rich that there was no health in us; and
now that we are, or soon will be, the wealthiest
nation in the world, they tell us that we continue
to maintain the same feverish pace in all that we
undertake or do.</p>

<p>I am not sure that this charge could not be
brought against the Englishman, Frenchman, or
German of to-day with almost equal justice, or,
in other words, that it is a characteristic of the
age rather than of our nation; but that conviction
would merely solace our pride and could not
assuage “that tired feeling” of which so many
are conscious. At all events, if we do not work
harder than our kinsmen across the sea, we seem
to bear the strain less well. It may be the climate,
as my wife has said, which causes our nervous
systems to rebel; but then, again, we cannot
change the climate, and consequently must adapt
ourselves to its idiosyncrasies.</p>

<p>Ever since we first began to declare that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
were superior to all other civilizations we have
been noted for our energy. The way in which we
did everything, from sawing wood to electing a
President, was conspicuous by virtue of the bustling,
hustling qualities displayed. But it is no
longer high treason to state that our national life,
in spite of its bustle, was, until comparatively recently,
lacking in color and variety. The citizen
who went to bed on the stroke of ten every night
and did practically the same thing each day from
one year’s end to the other was the ideal citizen
of the Republic, and was popularly described as
a conservative and a strong man. His life was
led within very repressed limits, and anything
more artistic than a chromo or religious motto
was apt to irritate him and shock his principles.
To be sure, we had then our cultivated class&mdash;more
narrowly but possibly more deeply cultivated
than its flourishing successor of to-day&mdash;but
the average American, despite his civic virtues
and consciousness of rectitude, led a humdrum
existence, however hustling or bustling.
There is a large percentage of our population that
continues to live in much the same manner, notwithstanding
the wave of enlightenment which
has swept over the country and keyed us all up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
to concert pitch by multiplying the number of
our interests. I feel a little guilty in having included
Rogers among this number, for I really
know of my own knowledge nothing about his
individual home life. It may be that I have been
doing him a rank injustice, and that his home is
in reality a seething caldron of progress. I referred
to him as a type rather than as an individual,
knowing as I do that there are still too
many homes in this country where music, art,
literature, social tastes, and intelligent interest in
human affairs in the abstract, when developed
beyond mere rudimentary lines, are unappreciated
and regarded as vanities or inanities.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there is nothing more interesting
in our present national evolution than
the eager recognition by the intelligent and aspiring
portion of the people that we have been
and are ignorant, and that the true zest of life
lies in its many-sidedness and its possibilities of
development along æsthetic, social, and intellectual
as well as moral lines. The United States
to-day is fairly bristling with eager, ambitious
students, and with people of both sexes, young
and middle-aged, who are anxiously seeking how
to make the most of life. This eagerness of soul<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
is not confined to any social class, and is noticeable
in every section of the country in greater or
less degree. It is quite as likely to be found among
people of very humble means as among those
whose earliest associations have brought them
into contact with the well-to-do and carefully
educated. Therefore I beg the pardon of Rogers
in case I have put him individually in the wrong
category. A divine yet cheery activity has largely
taken the place of sodden self-righteousness on
the one hand, and analytical self-consciousness
on the other. The class is not as yet very large
as compared with the entire population of the
country, but it is growing rapidly, and its members
are the most interesting men and women of
the Republic&mdash;those who are in the van of our
development as a people.</p>

<p>Overcrowded and congested lives signify at
least earnestness and absorption. Human nature
is more likely to aspire and advance when society
is nervously active, than when it is bovine
and self-congratulatory. But nerves can endure
only a certain amount of strain without reminding
human beings that strong and healthy bodies
are essential to true national progress. Only recently
in this country have we learned to consider<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the welfare of the body, and though we
have begun to be deadly in earnest about athletics,
the present generation of workers was,
for the most part, brought up on the theory that
flesh and blood was a limitation rather than a
prerequisite. We are doing bravely in this matter
so far as the education of our children is concerned,
but it is too late to do much for our own
nerves. Though stagnation is a more deplorable
state, it behooves us, nevertheless, if possible, to
rid ourselves of congestion for our ultimate
safety.</p>

<p>An active man or woman stopping to think
in the morning may well be appalled at the variety
of his or her life. The ubiquity of the modern
American subconsciousness is something
unique. We wish to know everything there is
to know. We are interested not merely in our
own and our neighbors’ affairs&mdash;with a knowledge
of which so many citizens of other lands
are peacefully contented&mdash;but we are eager to
know, and to know with tolerable accuracy, what
is going on all over the world&mdash;in England,
China, Russia, and Australia. Not merely politically,
but socially, artistically, scientifically,
philosophically, and ethically. No subject is too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
technical for our interest, provided it comes in
our way, whether it concern the canals in Mars
or the antitoxin germ. The newspaper and the
telegraph have done much to promote this ubiquity
of the mind’s eye all over the world, but the
interests of the average American are much wider
and more diversified than those of any other
people. An Englishman will have his hobbies
and know them thoroughly, but regarding affairs
beyond the pale of his limited inquiry he
is deliberately and often densely ignorant. He
reads, and reads augustly, one newspaper, one or
two magazines&mdash;a few books; we, on the other
hand, are not content unless we stretch out feelers
in many directions and keep posted, as we
call it, by hasty perusals of almost innumerable
publications for fear lest something escape us.
What does the Frenchman&mdash;the average intelligent
Frenchman&mdash;know or care about the mode
of our Presidential elections, and whether this
Republican or that Democrat has made or
marred his political reputation? We feel that we
require to inform ourselves not only concerning
the art and literature of France, but to have the
names and doings of her statesmen at our fingers’
ends for use in polite conversation, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
satisfaction of the remains of the New England
conscience. All this is highly commendable, if
it does not tend to render us superficial. The
more knowledge we have, the better, provided
we do not fall into the slough of knowing nothing
very well, or hunt our wits to death by over-acquisitiveness.
There is so much nowadays to
learn, and seemingly so little time in which to
learn it, we cannot afford to spread ourselves too
thin.</p>

<p>The energy of our people has always been
conspicuous in the case of women. The American
woman, from the earliest days of our history,
has refused to be prevented by the limitations of
time or physique from trying to include the entire
gamut of human feminine activity in her daily
experience. There was a period when she could
demonstrate successfully her ability to cook,
sweep, rear and educate children, darn her husband’s
stockings, and yet entertain delightfully,
dress tastefully, and be well versed in literature
and all the current phases of high thinking. The
New England woman of fifty years ago was certainly
an interesting specimen from this point
of view, in spite of her morbid conscience and
polar sexual proclivities. But among the well-to-do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
women of the nation to-day&mdash;the women who
correspond socially to those just described&mdash;this
achievement is possible only by taxing the
human system to the point of distress, except
in the newly or thinly settled portions of the
country, where the style of living is simple and
primitive.</p>

<p>In the East, of course, in the cities and towns
the women in question ceased long ago to do all
the housework; and among the well-to-do, servants
have relieved her of much, if not of all of
the physical labor. But, on the other hand, the
complexities of our modern establishments, and
the worry which her domestics cause her, make
the burden of her responsibilities fully equal to
what they were when she cooked flap-jacks and
darned stockings herself. In other countries the
women conversant with literature, art, and science,
who go in for philanthropy, photography,
or the ornamentation of china, who write papers
on sociological or educational matters, are, for
the most part, women of leisure in other respects.
The American woman is the only woman at
large in the universe who aims to be the wife
and mother of a family, the mistress of an establishment,
a solver of world problems, a social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
leader, and a philanthropist or artistic devotee
at one and the same time. Each of these interests
has its determined followers among the women
of other civilizations, but nowhere except
here does the eternal feminine seek to manifest
itself in so many directions in the same individual.</p>

<p>This characteristic of our womanhood is a virtue
up to a certain point. The American woman
has certainly impressed her theory that her sex
should cease to be merely pliant, credulous, and
ignorantly complacent so forcibly on the world
that society everywhere has been affected by it.
Her desire to make the most of herself, and to
participate as completely as possible in the vital
work of the world without neglecting the duties
allotted to her by the older civilizations, is in the
line of desirable evolution. But there is such a
thing as being superficial, which is far more to be
dreaded than even nervous prostration. Those
absorbed in the earnest struggle of modern living
may perhaps justly claim that to work until one
drops is a noble fault, and that disregard of one’s
own sensations and comfort is almost indispensable
in order to accomplish ever so little. But
there is nothing noble in superficiality; and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
would seem that the constant flitting from one
interest to another, which so many American women
seem unable to avoid, must necessarily tend
to prevent them from knowing or doing anything
thoroughly.</p>

<p>As regards the creature man, the critics of this
country have been accustomed to assert that he
was so much absorbed in making money, or in
business, as our popular phrase is, that he had
no time for anything else. This accusation used
to be extraordinarily true, and in certain parts of
the country it has not altogether ceased to be
true; though even there the persistent masculine
dollar-hunter regards wistfully and proudly the
æsthetic propensities of the female members of
his family, and feels that his labors are sweetened
thereby. This is a very different attitude from
the self-sufficiency of half a century ago. The
difficulty now is that our intelligent men, like our
women, are apt to attempt too much, inclined to
crowd into each and every day more sensations
than they can assimilate. An Englishwoman,
prominent in educational matters, and intelligent
withal, recently expressed her surprise to my
wife, Barbara, that the American gentleman existed.
She had been long familiar with the American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
woman as a charming, if original, native product,
but she had never heard of the American
gentleman&mdash;meaning thereby the alert, thoughtful
man of high purposes and good-breeding.
“How many there are!” the Briton went on to
say in the enthusiasm of her surprise. Indeed
there are. The men prominent in the leading
walks of life all over this country now compare
favorably, at least, with the best of other nations,
unless it be that our intense desire to know
everything has rendered, or may render, us accomplished
rather than profound.</p>

<h2>The <i>Use of Time</i>.</h2>

<h3>II.</h3>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a-2.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">After all, whether this suggestion
of a tendency toward superficiality
be well founded or not, the proper
use of time has come to be a more
serious problem than ever for the entire world.
The demands of modern living are so exacting
that men and women everywhere must exercise
deliberate selection in order to live wisely. To
lay down general rules for the use of time would
be as futile as to insist that every one should use
coats of the same size and color, and eat the same
kind and quantity of food. The best modern living
may perhaps be correctly defined as a happy
compromise in the aims and actions of the individual
between self-interest and altruism.</p>

<p>If one seeks to illustrate this definition by example
it is desirable in the first place to eliminate
the individuals in the community whose use of
time is so completely out of keeping with this
doctrine that it is not worth while to consider
them. Murderers, forgers, and criminals of all
kinds, including business men who practise petty
thefts, and respectable tradesmen who give short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
weight and overcharge, instinctively occur to us.
So do mere pleasure-seekers, drunkards, and idle
gentlemen. On the same theory we must exclude
monks, deliberate celibates, nuns, and all fanatical
or eccentric persons whose conduct of life,
however serviceable in itself as a leaven or an
exception, could not be generally imitated without
disaster to society. It would seem also as
though we must exclude those who have yet to
acquire such elemental virtues of wise living as
cleanliness, reverence for the beautiful, and a certain
amount of altruism. There is nothing to
learn as to the wise use of time from those whose
conceptions of life are handicapped by the habitual
use of slang and bad grammar and by untidiness;
who regard the manifestations of good
taste and fine scholarship as “frills,” and who,
though they be unselfish in the bosoms of their
families, take no interest in the general welfare
of the community.</p>

<p>Let me in this last connection anticipate the
criticism of the sentimentalist and of the free-born
American who wears a chip on his shoulder, by
stating that time may be as beautifully and wisely
spent, and life be as noble and serviceable to
humanity in the home of the humblest citizen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
as in that of the well-to-do or rich. Of course it
may. Who questions it? Did I not, in order not
even to seem to doubt it, take back all I hazarded
about the manner in which Rogers spends his
time? It <em>may</em> be just as beautifully and wisely
spent, and very often is so. But, on the other
hand, I suggest, timorously and respectfully, that
it very often is not, and I venture further to ask
whether the burden is not on democracy to show
that the plain life of the plain people as at present
conducted is a valuable example of wise and
improving use of time? The future is to account
for itself, and we all have faith in democracy. We
are all plain people in this country. But just as a
passing inquiry, uttered not under my breath,
yet without levity or malice, what is the contribution
so far made by plainness as plainness to
the best progress of the world? Absolutely nothing,
it seems to me. Progress has come from the
superiority of individuals in every class of life to
the mass of their contemporaries. The so-called
plainness of the plain people too often serves at
the present day as an influence to drag down the
aspiring individual to the dead level of the mass
which contents itself with bombastic cheapness
of thought and action. This is no plea against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
democracy, for democracy has come to stay; but
it is an argument why the best standards of living
are more likely to be found among those who
do not congratulate themselves on their plainness
than those who are content to live no better
and no worse than their neighbors. Discontent
with self is a valuable Mentor in the apportionment
of time.</p>

<p>Therefore I offer as the most valuable study
in the use of time under modern conditions the
men and women in our large cities who are so
far evolved that they are not tempted to commit
common crimes, are well educated, earnest and
pleasing, and are keenly desirous to effect in their
daily lives that happy compromise between self-interest
and altruism to which I have referred as
the goal of success in the use of time. Let us consider
them from the point of every day in the
week and of the four seasons. In every man’s life
his occupation, the calling or profession by which
he earns his bread, must necessarily be the chief
consumer of his time. We Americans have never
been an idle race, and it is rare that the father of
a family exposes himself to the charge of sloth.
His work may be unintelligent or bungling, but
he almost invariably spends rather too much than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
too little time over it. If you ask him why, he
says he cannot help it; that in order to get on
he must toil early and late. If he is successful,
he tells you that otherwise he cannot attend to
all he has to do. There is plausibility in this.
Competition is undoubtedly so fierce that only
those who devote themselves heart and soul to
any calling are likely to succeed. Moreover, the
consciousness of success is so engrossing and inspiriting
that one may easily be tempted to sacrifice
everything else to the game.</p>

<p>But can it be doubted, on the other hand, that
the man who refuses to become the complete
slave either of endeavor or success is a better
citizen than he who does? The chief sinners in
this respect in our modern life are the successful
men, those who are in the thick of life doing
reasonably well. The man who has not arrived,
or who is beginning, must necessarily have leisure
for other things for the reason that his time
is not fully employed, but the really busy worker
must make an effort or he is lost. If he does not
put his foot down and determine what else he
will do beside pursuing his vocation every day
in the year except Sunday, and often on Sunday
to boot, he may be robust enough to escape a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
premature grave, but he will certainly not make
the best use of his life.</p>

<p>The difficulty for such men, of course, is to select
what they will do. There are so many things,
that it is easy to understand why the mind which
abhors superficiality should be tempted to shut
its ears out of sheer desperation to every other
interest but business or profession. If every one
were to do that what would be the result? Our
leading men would simply be a horde of self-seekers,
in spite of the fact that their individual
work in their several callings was conscientious
and unsparing of self. Deplorable as a too great
multiplicity of interests is apt to be to the welfare
and advancement of an ambitious man, the
motive which prompts him to endeavor to do
many things is in reality a more noble one, and
one more beneficial to society than absorption
to excess in a vocation. The cardinal principle
in the wise use of time is to discover what one
can do without and to select accordingly. Man’s
duty to his spiritual nature, to his æsthetic nature,
to his family, to public affairs, and to his
social nature, are no less imperative than his duty
to his daily calling. Unless each of these is in
some measure catered to, man falls short in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
true obligations. Not one of them can be neglected.
Some men think they can lighten the
load to advantage by disregarding their religious
side. Others congratulate themselves that they
never read novels or poetry, and speak disrespectfully
of the works of new schools of art as
daubs. A still larger number shirks attention to
political and social problems, and declares bluffly
that if a man votes twice a year and goes to a
caucus, when he is sent for in a carriage by the
committee, it is all that can be expected of a busy
man. Another large contingent swathes itself in
graceless virtue, and professes to thank God that
it keeps aloof from society people and their doings.
Then we are all familiar with the man who
has no time to know his own family, though,
fortunately, he is less common than he used to
be.</p>

<p>If I were asked to select what one influence
more than another wastes the spare time of the
modern man, I should be inclined to specify the
reading of newspapers. The value of the modern
daily newspaper as a short cut to knowledge of
what is actually happening in two hemispheres
is indisputable, provided it is read regularly so
that one can eliminate from the consciousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
those facts which are contradicted or qualified on
the following day. Of course it is indispensable
to read the morning, and perhaps the evening,
newspaper in order to know what is going on
in the world. But the persistent reading of many
newspapers, or the whole of almost any newspaper,
is nearly as detrimental to the economy
of time as the cigarette habit to health. Fifteen
minutes a day is ample time in which to glean
the news, and the busy man who aspires to use
his time to the best advantage may well skip the
rest. There is no doubt that many of our newspapers
contain some of the best thought of the
day scattered through their encyclopædic columns;
but there is still less doubt that they are
conducted to please, first of all, those who otherwise
would read nothing. From this point of
view they are most valuable educators; moreover,
the character of the newspaper is steadily
improving, and it is evident that those in charge
of the best of them are seeking to raise the public
taste instead of writing down to it; but the
fact remains that they at present contain comparatively
little which the earnest man can afford
to linger over if he would avoid mental dissipation
of an insidious kind. A newspaper containing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
only the news and the really vital thought of
the day compressed into short space is among the
successful enterprises of the future which some
genius will perpetuate. How many of us, already,
weary of the social gossip, the sensational personalities,
the nauseous details of crime, the custom-made
articles, the Sunday special features,
the ubiquitous portrait, and finally the colored
cartoon, would write our names large on such a
subscription-list!</p>

<p>In the matter of books, too, the modern man
and woman may well exercise a determined
choice. There is so much printed nowadays between
ornamental covers, that any one is liable
to be misled by sheer bewilderment, and deliberate
selection is necessary to save us from being
mentally starved with plenty. We cannot always
be reading to acquire positive knowledge; entertainment
and self-oblivion are quite as legitimate
motives for the hard worker as meditated self-improvement;
but whether we read philosophy
and history, or the novel, the poem, and the
essay, it behooves us to read the best of its kind.
From this standpoint the average book club is
almost a positive curse. A weekly quota of books
appears on our library tables, to be devoured in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
seven days. We read them because they come
to us by lot, not because we have chosen them
ourselves. There is published in every year of
this publishing age a certain number of books
of positive merit in the various departments of
literature and thought, which a little intelligent
inquiry would enable us to discover. By reading
fewer books, and making sure that the serious
ones were sound and the light or clever ones
really diverting, the modern man and woman
would be gainers both in time and approbation.</p>

<p>In this connection let me head off again the sentimentalist
and moralist by noting that old friends
in literature are often more satisfying and engaging
than new. Those of us who are in the thick
of life are too apt to forget to take down from
our shelves the comrades we loved when we
were twenty-one&mdash;the essayists, the historians,
the poets, and novelists whose delightful pages
are the literature of the world. An evening at
home with Shakespeare is not the depressing
experience which some clever people imagine.
One rises from the feast to go to bed with all
one’s æsthetic being refreshed and fortified as
though one had inhaled oxygen. What a contrast
this to the stuffy taste in the roof of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
mouth, and the weary, dejected frame of mind
which follow the perusal of much of the current
literature which cozening booksellers have induced
the book club secretary to buy.</p>

<p>A very little newspaper reading and a limited
amount of selected reading will leave time for
the hobby or avocation. Every man or woman
ought to have one; something apart from business,
profession, or housekeeping, in which he
or she is interested as a study or pursuit. In this
age of the world it may well take the form of
educational, economic, or philanthropic investigation,
or co-operation, if individual tastes happen
to incline one to such work. The prominence
of such matters in our present civilization is, of
course, a magnet favorable to such a choice. In
this way one can, as it were, kill two birds with
one stone, develop one’s own resources and perform
one’s duty toward the public. But, on the
other hand, there will be many who have no
sense of fitness for this service, and whose predilections
lead them toward art, science, literature,
or some of their ramifications. The amateur
photographer, the extender of books, the observer
of birds, are alike among the faithful. To
have one hobby and not three or four, and to persevere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
slowly but steadily in the fulfilment of
one’s selection, is an important factor in the wise
disposal of time. It is a truism to declare that a
few minutes in every day allotted to the same
piece of work will accomplish wonders; but the
result of trying will convince the incredulous.
Indeed one’s avocation should progress and prevail
by force of spare minutes allotted daily and
continuously; just so much and no more, so as
not to crowd out the other claimants for consideration.
Fifteen minutes before breakfast, or
between kissing the children good-night and the
evening meal, or even every other Saturday afternoon
and a part of every holiday, will make
one’s hobby look well-fed and sleek at the end
of a few years.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most difficult side of one’s nature
to provide for adequately is the social side. It is
easy enough to make a hermit of one’s self and
go nowhere; and it is easy enough to let one’s
self be sucked into the vortex of endless social
recreation until one’s sensations become akin to
those of a highly varnished humming-top. I am
not quite sure which is the worse; but I am inclined
to believe that the hermit, especially if
self-righteous, is more detestable in that he is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
less altruistic. He may be a more superior person
than the gadfly of society, but ethics no longer
sanctions self-cultivation purely for the benefit
of self. Every man and woman who seeks to play
an intelligent part in the world ought to manage
to dine out and attend other social functions
every now and then, even if it be necessary to
bid for invitations. Most of us have more invitations
than we can possibly accept, and find the
problem of entertaining and being entertained an
exceedingly perplexing one to solve from the
standpoint of time. But in spite of the social
proclivities of most of us, there are still many
people who feel that they are fulfilling their complete
duty as members of society if they live
lives of strict rectitude far from the madding
crowd of so-called society people, and never
darken the doors of anybody. It is said that it
takes all sorts of people to make up the world,
but disciplinarians and spoil-sports of this sort
are so tiresome that they would not be missed
were they and their homilies to be translated prematurely
to another sphere.</p>

<p>Those of us, however, who profess a contrary
faith, experience difficulty at times in being true
to it, and are often tempted to slip back into domestic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
isolation by the feverishness of our social
life. It sometimes seems as though there were no
middle way between being a humming-top and a
hermit. Yet nothing is more fatal to the wise use
of time than the acceptance of every invitation
received, unless it be the refusal of every one.
Here again moderation and choice are the only
safeguards, in spite of the assurance of friends
that it is necessary to go a great deal in order to
enjoy one’s self. In our cities the bulk of the entertainments
of the year happen in the four winter
months; from which many far from frivolous
persons argue that the only way is to dine out
every night, and go to everything to which one
is asked during this period, and make up between
April 15th and December 15th for any
arrears due the other demands of one’s nature.
This is plausible, but a dangerous theory, if carried
to excess. Wise living consists in living
wisely from day to day, without excepting any
season. Three evenings in a week spent away
from one’s own fireside may not be an easy limit
for some whose social interests are varied, but
both the married and the single who regret politely
in order to remain tranquilly at home four
evenings out of seven, need not fear that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
have neglected the social side of life even in the
gayest of seasons.</p>

<p>And here, for the sake of our sometimes dense
friend the moralist&mdash;especially the moralist of
the press, who raves against society people from
the virtuous limit of an occasional afternoon tea&mdash;let
me add that by entertainments and recreation
I intend to include not merely formal balls
and dinner-parties, but all the forms of more or
less innocent edification and diversion&mdash;teas,
reform meetings, theatres, receptions, concerts,
lectures, clubs, sociables, fairs, and tableaux, by
which people all over the country are brought
together to exchange ideas and opinions in good-humored
fellowship.</p>

<p>In the apportionment of time the consideration
of one’s physical health is a paramount necessity,
not merely for a reasonably long life, but
to temper the mind’s eye so that the point of
view remain sane and wholesome. An overwrought
nervous system may be capable of spasmodic
spurts, but sustained useful work is impossible
under such conditions. To die in harness
before one’s time may be fine, and in exceptional
cases unavoidable, but how much better to live
in harness and do the work which one has undertaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
without breaking down. Happily the
young men and women of the country of the
present generation may almost be said to have
athletics and fresh air on the brain. What with
opportunity and precept they can scarcely help
living up to the mark in this respect. The grown-up
men and women, absorbed in the struggle of
life, are the people who need to keep a watchful
eye upon themselves. It is so easy to let the
hour’s fresh air and exercise be crowded out by
the things which one feels bound to do for the
sake of others, and hence for one’s immortal soul.
We argue that it will not matter if we omit our
walk or rest for a day or two, and so we go on
from day to day, until we are brought up with
a round turn, as the saying is, and realize, in case
we are still alive, that we are chronic invalids.
The walk, the ride, the drive, the yacht, the bicycle,
the search for wild flowers and birds, the
angler’s outing, the excursion with a camera,
the deliberate open-air breathing spell on the
front platform of a street-car, some one of these
is within the means and opportunities of every
busy worker, male and female.</p>

<p>For many of us the most begrudged undertaking
of all is to find time for what we owe to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the world at large or the State, the State with a
capital S, as it is written nowadays. There is no
money in such bestowals, no private gain or emolument.
What we give we give as a tribute to pure
altruism, or, in other words, because as men and
women we feel that it is one of the most important
elements in wise living. It is indisputable
that there was never so much disinterested endeavor
in behalf of the community at large as
there is to-day, but at the same time it is true
that the agitations and work are accomplished by
a comparatively small number of people. There
are probably among the intelligent, aspiring portion
of the population at least five persons who
intend to interest themselves in public affairs, and
regard doing so as essential to a useful life, to
every one who puts his theories into practice.
No man or woman can do everything. We cannot
as individuals at one and the same time busy
ourselves successfully in education, philanthropy,
political reform, and economic science. But if
every one would take an active, earnest concern
in something, in some one thing, and look into
it slowly but thoroughly, this man or woman in
the public schools, this in the methods of municipal
government, and this in the problems of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
crime or poverty, reforms would necessarily proceed
much faster. Just a little work every other
day or every week. Let it be your hobby if you
will, if you have no time for a hobby too. If five
thousand men in every large city should take an
active interest in and give a small amount of time
in every week to the school question, we should
soon have excellent public schools; if another five
thousand would devote themselves to the affairs
of municipal government in a similar fashion,
would there be so much corruption as at present,
and would so inferior a class of citizens be
chosen to be aldermen and to fill the other city
offices? And so on to the end of the chapter. Is
not something of the kind the duty of every earnest
man and woman? Let those who boast of being
plain people put this into their pipes and
smoke it. When the self-styled working-classes
are prohibited by law from working more than
eight hours, will they contribute of their spare
time to help those who are trying to help
them?</p>

<p>American men have the reputation of being
considerate husbands and indulgent fathers; but
they have been apt at all events, until recently,
to make permission to spend take the place of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
personal comradeship. This has been involuntarily
and regretfully ascribed to business pressure;
but fatalistic remorse is a poor substitute
for duty, even though the loved ones eat off gold
plate and ride in their own carriages as a consequence.
We Americans who have begotten children
in the last twenty years do not need to be
informed that the time given to the society of
one’s wife and family is the most precious expenditure
of all, both for their sakes and our own.
But though the truth is obvious to us, are we not
sometimes conscious at the end of the week that
the time due us and them has been squandered
or otherwise appropriated? Those walks and
talks, those pleasant excursions from city to
country, or country to city, those quiet afternoons
or evenings at home, which are possible
to every man and woman who love each other
and their children, are among the most valuable
aids to wise living and peace of mind which daily
existence affords. Intimacy and warm sympathy,
precept and loving companionship, are worth all
the indulgent permission and unexpected cheques
in the world. Some people, when Sunday or a
holiday comes, seem to do their best to get rid
of their families and to try to amuse themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
apart from them. Such men and women are shutting
out from their lives the purest oxygen which
civilization affords; for genuine comradeship of
husband and wife, and father or mother and child,
purges the soul and tends to clear the mind’s eye
more truly than any other influence.</p>

<p>Lastly and firstly, and in close compact with
sweet domesticity and faithful friendship, stand
the spiritual demands of our natures. We must
have time to think and meditate. Just as the flowers
need the darkness and the refreshing dew, the
human soul requires its quiet hours, its season
for meditation and rest. Whatever we may believe,
whatever doubts we may entertain regarding
the mysteries of the universe, who will maintain
that the aspiring side of man is a delusion
and an unreality? In the time&mdash;often merely
minutes&mdash;which we give to contemplation and
serious review of what we are doing, lies the secret
of the wise plan, if not the execution. To go
on helter-skelter from day to day without a purpose
in our hearts resembles playing a hurdy-gurdy
for a living without the hope of pence.
The use of Sunday in this country has changed
so radically in the last twenty-five years that
every one is free to spend it as he will, subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
to certain restrictions as to sport and entertainment
in public calculated to offend those who
would prefer stricter usages. But whether we
choose to go to church or not, whether our aspirations
are fostered in the sanctuary or the fresh
air, the eternal needs of the soul must be provided
for. If we give our spare hours and minutes
merely to careless amusement, we cannot
fail to degenerate in nobility of nature, just as
we lose the hue of health when we sully the red
corpuscles of the body with foul air and steam
heat. Are we not nowadays, even the plain people,
God bless them, too much disposed to believe
that merely to be comfortable and amused
and rested is the sole requirement of the human
soul? It does need rest most of the time in this
age of pressure, Heaven knows, and comfort and
amusement are necessary. But may we not, even
while we rest and are comfortable, under the blue
sky or on the peaceful river, if you will, lift up
our spirits to the mystery of the ages, and reach
out once more toward the eternal truths? Merely
to be comfortable and to get rested once a week
will not bring those truths nearer. May we not,
in the pride of our democracy, afford to turn our
glances back to the pages of history, to the long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
line of mighty men kneeling before the altar with
their eyes turned up to God, and the prayer of
faith and repentance on their lips? Did this all
mean nothing? Are we so wise and certain and
far-seeing that we need not do likewise?</p>

<h2>The <i>Summer Problem</i>.</h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-w-2.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">What is the good American to
do with himself or herself in summer?
The busiest worker nowadays
admits that a vacation of a
fortnight in hot weather is at least
desirable. Philanthropy sends yearly more and
more children on an outing in August, as one of
the best contributions to the happiness and welfare
of the poor. The atmosphere of our large
cities in midsummer is so lifeless and oppressive
that every one who can get away for some part
of the summer plans to do so, and fathers of
families find themselves annually confronted by
a serious problem.</p>

<p>I specify the father of a family because the
problem is so much easier for a single man. The
single man, and generally the single woman, can
pack a bag and go to the beach or mountains, or
to a hotel within easy distance from town, without
much premeditation. The worst that can happen
to them is that they may become engaged
without intention; besides they can always come
home if they are dissatisfied with their surroundings.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
But the family man who lives in a large
city finds more and more difficulty every year,
as the country increases in population, in making
up his mind how best to provide for the
midsummer necessities of his wife and children.
There are several courses of action open to
him.</p>

<p>He can remain in town and keep his family
there.</p>

<p>He can remain in town himself and send his
family to a distance.</p>

<p>He can hire a house or lodgings by the sea or
in the country within easy reach of town by railroad
or steamboat.</p>

<p>He can send his family to a summer hotel at a
distance, or take a house or lodgings at a distance,
making occasional flying trips to and from
town, according to his opportunities.</p>

<p>To stay in town and keep one’s family there
is a far from disagreeable experience except in
very large cities in unusually hot weather. The
custom of going away from home in summer is
one which has grown by force of imitation. The
inclination to change one’s surroundings, and to
give the wife and children a whiff of country or
sea or mountain air for a few weeks in the course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
of the year is an ambition which is neither godless
nor extravagant. But it is not worth while
to set this necessity up as an idol to be worshipped
at the expense of comfort for the rest of
the year, for, after all, our ancestors successfully
reared large families of children, including some
of us, without going away from home in the summer,
and “the-can’t-get-aways” in our largest
and most uncomfortable cities still outnumber
those who can and do in the proportion of at
least five to one. It costs more to go away than
to stay in town; from which certain native philosophers,
who maintain that any one who spends
more than twenty-five hundred dollars on his
family in any one year is not a good American,
may argue that those who have both a summer
and a winter home are aristocrats and materialists.
Their argument is not likely to diminish
summer travel, to bankrupt the summer hotels,
or to induce the well-to-do American citizen to
shut up his cottage. A change in summer, for a
longer or shorter period, is generally recognized
as one of the most healthful and improving advantages
which a father in our civilization can
give his family and himself. On the other hand,
to go out of town simply because one’s neighbors<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
do, when one cannot afford it, is a pitiful
performance.</p>

<p>Moreover, the man who does not send his
family out of town from motives of economy,
has more than a clean conscience to comfort him.
He can remember that probably one-third of
the annual experiments in summer culture and
health-giving recreation, made by his friends
and acquaintance, turn out dire failures, and
that another one-third result in mixed joy and
comfort. He can reflect too, if he lives in the
suburbs of a city, or in a town or small city, that,
barring a few exceptionally hot days, he and his
family are really very comfortable at home. Even
if his household gods are in a parboiled metropolis,
he will commonly be able to relieve his tedium
and physical discomfort by some form of
excursion. All our seaboard cities have their midsummer
Meccas for the multitude in the form
of beaches; and even where no ocean breezes
blow, there is usually close at hand verdure, a
lake, a grove, or a river where the philosophical
soul can forget the thermometer, and cease to
commiserate with itself on being kept in town.
One’s own bed is never humpy, and the hollows
in it are just fitted to one’s bones or adipose developments.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
One can eat and drink in one’s
town-house without fear of indigestion or germs.
Decidedly the happiness of staying at home is
not much less than the happiness of passing one,
two, or three months at a place where everything
is uncomfortable or nasty, at a cost which one
can ill afford, if at all. Good city milk and succulent
city vegetables are luxuries which are rarely
to be found at the ordinary summer resort.</p>

<p>It is difficult to convince one’s family of this
in advance. Besides, man is always to be blessed.
We are always hoping that the next summer will
be a grand improvement on those which have
gone before, and generally by the first of May we
believe, or at least imagine, that we have discovered
the genuine article&mdash;the ideal spot at last.
Discovered it for our families. The American
father has the trick of sending his family out of
town for the summer, and staying at home himself.
This had its origin probably in his supposed
inability to escape from business in the
teeth of the family craving to see something of
the world outside of their own social acquaintance.
Yet he acknowledged the force of the family
argument that with such a large country to
explore it would be a pity not to explore it; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
accordingly he said, “Go, and I will join you if
and when I can.” Paterfamilias said this long
ago, and in some instances he has vainly been
trying to join them ever since. There are all
sorts of trying in this world, and perhaps his has
not been as determined as some; nevertheless,
he has maintained tolerably well the reputation
of trying. The Saturday night trains and steamboats
all over the country are vehicles, from
July first to October first, of an army of fathers
who are trying successfully to join their nearest
and dearest at the different summer-resorts of
the land.</p>

<p>To be separated for three months from one’s
wife and children, except for a day or two once a
fortnight, is scarcely an ideal domestic arrangement,
in spite of the fact that it is more or less
delightful for the dear ones to meet new people
and see new scenes. The American father may
not try very hard to leave his city home, but it
must be admitted that he has been an amiable
biped on the score of the summer question. He
has been and is ready to suffer silently for the
sake of his family and his business. But now that
he has made up his mind at last that he prefers to
leave his business for the sake of his family and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
his own health, the difficulties of sending them to
a distance are more apparent to him. Ten or fifteen
years ago it dawned upon him that the city
in summer without his family was not the ideal
spot his fancy had painted, and that the sea-side
and country, especially the former, were, after all,
the best place for an overworked, full-grown
man on a summer’s afternoon. It dawned upon
him, too, that there was sea-coast and country
close at hand where he could establish his family
and refresh himself at the end of every day’s
work. Twenty-five years ago the marine and attractive
suburban environs of our cities were
substantially unappropriated. To-day they bristle
with cottages, large and small, the summer
homes of city men. Every available promontory,
island, hill, nook, and crook, which commands
a pleasing view or is visited by cooling breezes
is, or soon will be, occupied. What can a busy
man do better, if he can afford it, than buy or
hire a cottage, as humble as you like, to which
he can return in the afternoon to the bosom of
his own family, and be comfortable and lazy until
morning?</p>

<p>From the domestic point of view this is assuredly
the most satisfactory arrangement for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
father, and the American paterfamilias, ever since
the truth dawned upon him, has been prompt in
recognizing the fact. He has builded, too, according
to his taste, whim, and individual idiosyncrasies.
A sea-side cottage within easy reach
of town includes, to-day, every variety of shelter
from a picturesque villa of the most super-civilized
type to the hulk of a ship fitted up as a
camping-out home. To a large extent, too, the
hotel has been discarded in favor of the domestic
hearth, even though the single chimney smokes
so that tears are perpetually in the domestic eye.
The well-to-do city man who comes to town
every day appreciates that a hotel is a poor place
for children; consequently the long piazzas,
where the terrible infant forever used to abound,
are now trodden chiefly by visitors from a distance
and transients who have escaped from the
city for a day in search of a sea-bath and a clam
chowder.</p>

<p>If the summer cottage to which the husband
returns at night, is not the most satisfactory arrangement
for the mother, she must blame herself
or the civilization in which she lives. The
sole argument in favor of passing the summer
at a hotel is that the wife and mother escapes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
thereby the cares of housekeeping, too often so
severe during the rest of the year that the prospect
of not being obliged to order dinner for
three months causes her to wake in the night
and laugh hysterically. Formality and conventional
ceremony are the lurking enemies of our
American summer life, who threaten to deprive
our mothers and daughters of the rest and vacation
from the tension, excitement, and worry
begotten by nine months of active domestic duties.
Simplicity of living ought to be the controlling
warm-weather maxim of every household
where the woman at the head of the establishment
does the housekeeping, as nine thousand
nine hundred and ninety-nine women out of ten
thousand in America do.</p>

<p>It may be argued that greater simplicity in
living all the year round would enable the wife
and mother to do without a vacation. Possibly.
But unfortunately for her the trend of the tide
is all the other way. Besides, simplicity is such
a difficult word to conjure with. Her interests
have become so varied that the wear and tear is
quite as likely to proceed from new mental strivings
as from a multiplicity of sheer domestic
duties. At least there seems to be no immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
prospect that she will be less tired in the spring,
however exemplary her intentions, and it therefore
behooves her not to allow the wave of increasing
luxury to bear her on its crest through
the summer and land her in her town-house in
October a physical and mental wreck.</p>

<p>The external attractiveness of the modern
summer cottage, with its pleasing angles and
comely stains, is easily made an excuse for an
artistic interior and surroundings to match. But
artistic beauty in summer can readily be produced
without elaboration, and at comparatively
slight cost, if we only choose to be content with
simple effects. The bewitching charm of the summer
girl, if analyzed, proves to be based on a
few cents a yard and a happy knack of combining
colors and trifles. Why need we be solicitous
to have all the paraphernalia of winter-life&mdash;meals
with many courses, a retinue of servants,
wines, festal attire, and splendid entertainments?
While we rejoice that the promiscuous comradeship
of hotel life has largely given place at Newport,
Bar Harbor, Lenox, and our other fashionable
watering-places to the pleasant protection
of the cottage home, is it not seriously deplorable
that simplicity is too often lost sight of? To be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
comfortable is one thing, to be swathed in luxury
or to be tortured by ceremony all the time is another.
It seems strange to many of us, who cannot
choose precisely what we will do and where we will
go in summer, that those who can so often select a
mere repetition of mid-winter social recreation.</p>

<p>There is Patterson the banker for instance, the
employer of Rogers. He can go where he pleases,
and he goes to Newport. One can see him any
afternoon driving augustly on Bellevue Avenue
or along the ocean drive, well gloved, well shod,
and brilliantly necktied, in his landau beside Mrs.
Patterson. They have been to Newport for years
in summer, and their house, with its beautiful outlook
to sea, has doubled and trebled in value. How
do they pass their time? Entertain and let themselves
be entertained. Dinners with formal comestibles,
late dances, champagne luncheons, <i lang="fr">paté
de fois gras</i> picnics on a coach are their daily associations.
Mr. and Mrs. Patterson are close upon
sixty themselves, but they follow&mdash;a little more
solemnly than formerly, but still without stint&mdash;the
same programme, which grows more and more
elaborate with each succeeding year. It was there
that their youngest daughter was married six
months ago, with widely heralded splendor, to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Russian nobleman who speaks beautiful English.
May her lot be a happy one! The son, who went
through the Keeley cure, and the elder daughter,
who is separated from her husband, have spent
their summers at Newport from their youth up.</p>

<p>There are comparatively few who have the
means to live, or who do live just like Patterson,
but there is many a man of fine instincts and with
a sufficient income to maintain a summer home,
who finds himself to-day oppressed by the incubus
of things. He seeks rest, books, fresh air,
the opportunity to enjoy nature&mdash;the sea, the
foliage, the flowers&mdash;and yet he is harassed by
things, the very things he has all winter, with a
garnishment suitable to hot weather. He wishes
to be still; and things keep him moving. He
yearns to strip off, if not all his clothing, at least
enough of it to give his lungs and his soul full
play; but things keep him faultlessly dressed.
He intends to slake his thirst only from the old
oaken bucket or the milk-pail, and things keep
his palate titillated with champagne and cocktails.
Our old-time simplicity in summer is perhaps
no longer possible in the large watering-places.
It is even with considerable satisfaction
that we don, and see our wives and children don,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
the attractive clothing which has taken the place
of shirt-sleeves and flannel shirts as articles of
toilette; but is it not time to cry halt in our procession
toward luxury, if we do not wish to live
on our nerves all the year round?</p>

<p>It is this difficulty in escaping the expenses
and the formality of city life in the summer cottage
or at the summer hotel, almost as much as
the fact that the desirable locations near town
have all been taken, which is inclining the American
father to send his family to a distance. After
twenty-five years of exploration the outlying
beaches and other favorite resorts near our large
cities have become so thoroughly appropriated
that the man who wishes to build or own a summer
home of his own is obliged to look elsewhere.
As a consequence cottages have sprung
up all along the line of our coast, from the farthest
confines of Maine to New Jersey, on the
shores of the lakes of the Middle West, and on
the Pacific shore. Many of these are of a simple
and attractive character, and generally they stand
in small colonies, large enough for companionship
and not too large for relaxation. With the
similar double purpose of obtaining an attractive
summer home at a reasonable price, and of avoiding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
the stock watering-place, city families are
utilizing also the abandoned farm. There is not
room for us all on the sea-coast; besides those
of us whose winter homes are there are more
likely to need inland or mountain air. There are
thousands of beautiful country spots, many of
them not so very far from our homes, where the
run-down farm can be redeemed, if not to supply
milk and butter, at least to afford a picturesque
shelter and a lovely landscape during the
season when we wish to be out of doors as much
as possible. A very few changes, a very little
painting and refurnishing will usually transform
the farm-house itself into just the sort of establishment
which a family seeking rest and quiet
recreation ought to delight in. You may bring
mosquito-frames for the windows if you like, and
you must certainly test the well-water. Then
swing your hammock between two apple-trees
and thank Providence that you are not like so
many of your friends and acquaintances, working
the tread-mill of society in the dog-days.</p>

<p>Of course most men who have homes of this
description at a distance cannot be with their
families all the time. But, on the other hand, the
conviction that a busy man can do better work in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
ten or eleven months than in twelve, is gaining
ground, and most of us, if we only choose to, can
slip away for at least three weeks. Many of the
demands of modern civilization on the family
purse cannot be resisted without leaving the husband
and parent a little depressed; but it seems
to me that a serious item of expense may be
avoided, and yet all the genuine benefits and
pleasures of a change of scene and atmosphere be
obtained, if we only dismiss from our minds the
idea of living otherwise than simply. A little
house with very little in it, with a modest piazza,
a skiff or sail-boat which does not pretend to be a
yacht, a garden hoe and rake, a camera, books and
a hammock, a rod which is not too precious or
costly to break, one nag of plebeian blood and
something to harness him to, rabbits in the barn
and sunflowers in the garden, a walk to sunset
hill and a dialogue with the harvest moon&mdash;why
should we not set our summer life to such a tune,
rather than hanker for the neighborhood of the
big steam-yacht and polo-ground, for the fringe
of the fashionable bathing beach, for the dust of
the stylish equipage, and try in our several ways,
and beyond our means, to follow the pace which
is set for us by others?</p>

<p class="dropcap">Why? Largely on account of that
newly created species, the American
girl. From solicitude for her happiness
and out of deference to her
wishes. Many a father and mother would be delighted
to pass the summer on an abandoned
farm or in any other spot where it were possible
to live simply and to be cool, comfortable, and
lazy, but for fear of disappointing their young
people&mdash;principally their daughters, who, unlike
the sons, cannot yet come and go at will.
Feminine youth has its inherent privileges everywhere,
but the gentle sway which it exercises in
other civilizations has become almost a sour tyranny
here. Was there ever an American mother
who knew anything portrayed in fiction? The
American daughter is commonly presented as a
noble-souled, original creature, whose principal
mission in life, next to or incidental to refusing
the man who is not her choice, is to let her own
parents understand what weak, ignorant, foolish,
unenlightened persons they are in comparison
with the rising generation&mdash;both parents in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
some measure, but chiefly and utterly the mother.
She is usually willing to concede that her
father has a few glimmering ideas, and a certain
amount of sense&mdash;horse business sense, not very
elevating or inspiring&mdash;yet something withal.
But she looks upon her poor dear mother as a
feeble-minded individual of the first water. What
we read in contemporary fiction in this realistic
age is apt to be photographed from existing conditions.
The newly created species of our homes
does not always reveal these sentiments in so
many words; indeed she is usually disposed to
conceal from her parents as far as possible their
own shortcomings, believing often, with ostrich-like
complacency, that they have no idea what
she really thinks of them. Quite frequently late
in life it dawns upon her that they were not such
complete imbeciles as she had adjudged them,
and she revises her convictions accordingly. But
often she lives superior to the end.</p>

<p>It would be an excellent thing for the American
girl if her eyes could be definitely opened to
the fact that her parents, particularly her mother,
are much more clever than she supposes, and that
they are really her best counsellors. But on the
other hand, is not the American mother herself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
chiefly responsible for this attitude of loving contempt
and sweet but unfilial condescension on
the part of her own flesh and blood? It sometimes
seems as though we had fallen victims to
our reluctance to thwart our children in any way
lest we should destroy their love for us. But is
it much preferable to be loved devotedly as foolish,
weak, and amiable old things, than to be
feared a little as individuals capable of exercising
authority and having opinions of our own?</p>

<p>This yielding, self-abnegating tendency on the
part of parents, and consequent filial tyranny, are
especially conspicuous in the case of that arch
despot, the summer girl. I admit her fascination
unreservedly, and am willing to concede that she
has run the gauntlet of criticism hurled at her by
the effete civilizations with an unblemished reputation.
Though she may have become a little
more conservative and conventional out of deference
to good taste, she is still able to be lost in
caves or stranded on islands with any young man
of her acquaintance without bringing a blush to
any cheek except that of the horror-stricken foreigner.
But having admitted this, I am obliged
to charge her with trampling on the prostrate
form of her mother from the first of July to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
first of October. She does so to a certain extent
the year round, but the summer is the crowning
season of her despotism.</p>

<p>The first concern of the American father and
mother in making plans for the summer is to go
to some place which the children will like, and
the summer girl in particular. This is natural and
in keeping with the unselfish devotion shown by
the present generation of parents toward their
children. But it is one thing to endeavor to select
a place which will be satisfactory to one’s
eighteen-year-old daughter and another to be
sweetly hectored by that talented young woman
into going to some place selected by her of which
you entirely disapprove. And just here it is that
the American mother almost seems to be convicted
of the feebleness of intellect ascribed to
her by the newly created species. You, the father,
are just screwing your courage up to say that you
will be blessed if you will go to a summer hotel
at Narragansett Pier (or wherever it is), when
your wife, who has been cowed or cajoled by the
despot in the interim, flops completely, as the
saying is, and joins an almost tearful support to
the summer girl’s petition. And there you are.
What are you to do? Daughter and mother, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
apple of your eye and the angel of your heart,
leagued against you. Resistance becomes impossible,
unless you are ready to incur the reputation
of being a stony-hearted old curmudgeon.</p>

<p>The summer girl invariably wishes to go where
it is gay. Her idea of enjoyment does not admit
domesticity and peaceful relaxation. She craves
to be actively amused, if not blissfully excited.
It is not strange that the tastes and sentiments of
young persons from seventeen to twenty-three
should differ considerably from those of mothers
and fathers from forty to fifty, and it speaks well
for the intelligence and unselfishness of middle-aged
parents and guardians in this country that
they so promptly recognize the legitimate claims
of youth, and even are eager to give young people
a chance to enjoy themselves before the cares
of life hedge them in. But have we not gone to
the other extreme? Is it meet that we should regard
ourselves as moribund at fifty, and sacrifice
all our own comfort and happiness in order to let
a young girl have her head, and lead a life in
summer of which we heartily disapprove? It is
not an exaggeration to state that there is a growing
disposition on the part of the rising hordes
of young men and girls to regard any one in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
society over thirty-five as a fossil and an encumbrance,
for whom, in a social sense, the grave is
yawning. It is not uncommon to hear a comely
matron of forty described as a frump by a youth
scarcely out of his teens, and every old gentleman
of thirty-nine has experienced the tactless pity
which fashionable maidens under twenty-one endeavor
to conceal in the presence of his senility.</p>

<p>The summer girl is generally a young person
who has been a winter girl for nine months. I
am quite aware that some girls are much more
effective in summer than at any other season, and
it may be that in certain cases they appear to so
little advantage in winter that to attempt to gratify
parental inclinations at their expense would
be rank unkindness. But it is safe to allege that
the average summer girl in this country has been
doing all she ought to do in the way of dancing,
prancing, gadding, going, working, and generally
spending her vital powers in the autumn, winter,
and spring immediately preceding, and consequently
when summer comes needs, quite as
much as her parents, physical, mental, and moral
ozone. But what does she prefer to do? Whither
is she bent on leading her father by the nose
with the assistance of her mother? To various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
places, according to her special predilection, and
the farthest limit of the parental purse. If possible,
to one of the gayest watering-places, where
she hopes to bathe, play tennis, walk, talk, and
drive during the day; paddle, stroll, or sit out during
the evening, and dance until twelve o’clock
at night two or three times a week. Else to some
much-advertised mountain cataract or lake resort,
to lead a stagnant hotel corridor and piazza
life, in the fond hope of seeing the vividly imagined
Him alight from the stage-coach some
Saturday night. Meanwhile she is one of three-score
forlorn girls who haunt the office and make
eyes at the hotel clerk. The summer girl has a
mania for the summer hotel. It seems to open
to her radiant possibilities. She kindles at the
mention of a hop in August, and if she is musical,
the tinkle of her piano playing reverberates
through the house all day until the other boarders
are driven nearly crazy. In the gloaming
after supper she flits off from the house with her
best young man of the moment, and presently
her mother is heard bleating along the piazza,
“My Dorothy has gone without her shawl, and
will catch her death a cold.”</p>

<p>And so it goes all summer. When autumn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
comes and the leaf is about to fall, and Dorothy
returns to town, what has she to show for it?
A little tan and a callous heart, a promised winter
correspondence with the hotel clerk, new
slang, some knack at banjo-playing, and considerable
uncertainty in her mind as to whom she is
engaged to, or whether she is engaged at all.
And like as not the doctor is sent for to build
her up for the winter with cod-liver oil and quinine.
There is too much ozone at some of these
summer hotels.</p>

<p>We cannot hope to do away wholly with either
the summer hotel or the fashionable watering-place
by the assertion of parental authority. Such
an endeavor, indeed, would on the whole be an
unjust as well as fruitless piece of virtue. The
delightful comradeship between young men and
young women, which is one of our national products,
is typified most saliently by the summer
girl and her attendant swains. Naturally she
wishes to go to some place where swains are apt
to congregate; and the swain is always in search
of her. Moreover, the summer hotel must continue
to be the summer home of thousands who,
for one reason or another, have no cottage or
abandoned farm. My plea is still the same, however.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Why, now that the negro slave is free, and
the workingman is being legislated into peace
and plenty, and the wrongs of other women are
being righted, should not the American mother
try to burst her bonds? It would be a much
more simple matter than it seems, for, after all,
she has her own blood in her veins, and she has
only to remember what a dogmatic person she
herself was in the days of her youth. If the code
of fathers and mothers, instead of that of girls
and boys, were in force at our summer hotels
and watering-places, a very different state of affairs
would soon exist; and that, too, without
undue interference with that inherent, cherished,
and unalienable right of the American daughter,
the maiden’s choice. We must not forget that
though our civilization boasts the free exercise
of the maiden’s choice as one of the brightest
jewels in the crown of republican liberties, the
crowded condition of our divorce courts forbids
us to be too demonstrative in our self-satisfaction.</p>

<p>It would be dire, indeed, to bore the young
person, especially the summer girl. But does it
necessarily follow that a summer home or a summer
life indicated by the parent would induce
such a disastrous result? I am advising neither a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
dungeon, a convent, nor some excruciatingly
dull spot to which no fascinating youth is likely
to penetrate. Verily, even the crowded bathing
beach may not corrupt, provided that wise motherly
control and companionship point out the
dangers and protect the forming soul, mind, and
manners, instead of allowing them to be distorted
and poisoned by the ups and downs of
promiscuous amatory summer guerilla warfare.
But may it not happen, when the maternal foot
is once firmly put down, that the summer girl
will not be so easily bored as she or her mother
fears, and will even be grateful for protection
against her own ignorance and inexperience?
Boating, sketching, riding, reading, bicycling,
travel, sewing, and photography are pastimes
which ought not to bore her, and would surely
leave her more refreshed in the autumn than continuous
gadding, dancing, and flirtation. To be a
member of a small, pleasant colony, where the
days are passed simply and lazily, yet interestingly;
where the finer senses are constantly appealed
to by the beauties of nature and the
healthful character of one’s occupations, is a
form of exile which many a summer girl would
accommodate herself to gladly if she only understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
what it was like, and understood, moreover,
that the selection of a summer programme
had ceased to be one of her prerogatives. A determined
man who wishes to marry will discover
the object of his affections on an abandoned farm
or in the heart of the Maine woods, if he is
worth his salt. In these days of many yachts and
bicycles true love can travel rapidly, and there
is no occasion for marriageable girls to select
courting-grounds where their lovers can have
close at hand a Casino and other conveniences,
including the opportunity to flirt with their next
best Dulcineas.</p>

<p>If the summer-time is the time in which to recuperate
and lie fallow, why should we have so
many summer schools? After the grand panjandrum
of Commencement exercises at the colleges
is over, there ought to be a pause in the
intellectual activity of the nation for at least sixty
days; yet there seems to be a considerable body
of men and women who, in spite of the fact that
they exercise their brains vigorously during the
rest of the year, insist on mental gymnastics when
the thermometer is in the eighties. These schools&mdash;chiefly
assemblies in the name of the ologies
and osophies&mdash;bring together more or less people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
more or less learned, from all over the country,
to talk at one another and read papers.</p>

<p>Judging merely from the newspaper accounts
of their proceedings, it is almost invariably impossible
to discover the exact meaning of anything
which is uttered, but this may be due to
the absence of the regular reporters on their annual
vacations, and the consequent delegation
to tyros of the difficult duty in question. But
even assuming that the utterances of the summer
schools are both intelligible and stimulating,
would not the serious-minded men and women
concerned in them be better off lying in a hammock
under a wide-spreading beech-tree, or, if
this seems too relaxing an occupation, watching
the bathers at Narragansett Pier? There is wisdom
sometimes in sending young and very active
boys to school for about an hour a day in
summer, in order chiefly to know where they
are and to prevent them from running their legs
off; but with this exception the mental workers
in this country, male and female, young and old,
can afford to close their text-books with a bang
on July 1st, and not peep at them again until
September. Philosophy in August has much the
flavor of asparagus in January.</p>

<h2>The <i>Case of Man</i>.</h2>

<h3>I.</h3>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a-1.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">A not inconsiderable portion of
the women of the United States
is inclined to regard man as a
necessary evil. Their point of
view is that he is here, and therefore
is likely, for the present at least, to remain
a formidable figure in human affairs, but that his
ways are not their ways, that they disapprove of
them and him, and that they intend to work out
their lives and salvation as independently of him
as possible. What man in the flush and prime
of life has not been made conscious of this attitude
of the modern woman? She is constantly
passing us in the street with the manner of one
haughtily and supremely indifferent. There are
women enough still who look patterns of modesty,
and yet let us feel at the same time that we
are more or less an object of interest to them;
but this particular type sails by in her trig and
often stylish costume with the air not merely of
not seeing us, but of wishing to ignore us. Her
compressed lips suggest a judgment; a judgment
born of meditated conviction which leaves no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
hope of reconsideration or exception. “You are
all substantially alike,” she seems to say, “and
we have had enough of you. Go your ways and
we will go ours.”</p>

<p>The Mecca of the modern woman’s hopes, as
indicated by this point of view, would appear to
be the ultimate disappearance of man from the
face of the earth after the manner of the mastodon
and other brutes. Nor are her hopes balked
by physiological barriers. She is prepared to admit
that it is not obvious, as yet, how girls alone
are to be generated and boy babies given the cold
maternal shoulder; but she trusts to science and
the long results of time for a victory which will
eliminate sexual relations and all their attendant
perplexities and tragedies from the theatre of
human life.</p>

<p>We are not so sanguine as she that the kingdom
of heaven is to be brought to pass in any so
simple and purely feminine a fashion. That is,
we men. Perhaps we are fatuous, but we see no
reason to doubt that sexual relations will continue
to the crack of doom, in spite of the perplexities
and tragedies consequent upon them;
and moreover, that man will continue to thrive
like a young bay-tree, even though she continues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
to wear a chip on her tailor-made shoulder.
And yet at the same time we feel sober. It is not
pleasant to be regarded as brutes and to have
judgment passed upon us by otherwise attractive
women. It behooves us to scratch our heads
and ask ourselves if we can possibly merit the
haughty indifference and thinly disguised contempt
which is entertained toward us. To be
weighed in the balance and found wanting by a
serene and beautiful young person is a far from
agreeable experience. There must be something
wrong with us, and if so, what is it?</p>

<p>Of course there was a time&mdash;and not so very
long ago&mdash;when men were tyrants and kept
women under. Nowadays the only thing denied
them in polite circles is to whisk around by
themselves after dark, and plenty of them do
that. The law is giving them, with both hands,
almost everything they ask for nearly as rapidly
as existing inequalities are pointed out, and the
right of suffrage is withheld from them only because
the majority of women are still averse to
exercising it. Man, the tyrant and highwayman,
has thrown up his arms and is allowing woman
to pick his pockets. He is not willing to have
her bore a hole in his upper lip, and drag him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
behind her with a rope, but he is disposed to
consent to any reasonable legislative changes
which she desires to have made, short of those
which would involve masculine disfigurement or
depreciation. It certainly cannot be his bullying
qualities which have attracted her disdain, for he
has given in. If woman to-day finds that the law
discriminates unjustly between her and man, she
has merely to ask for relief in sufficient numbers
to show that she is not the tool of designing
members of her own sex, in order to obtain it.</p>

<p>Under the spur of these reflections I consulted
my wife by way of obtaining light on this problem.
“Barbara, why is it that modern women of
a certain type are so sniffy toward men? You
know what I mean; they speak to us, of course,
and tolerate us, and they love us individually
as husbands and fathers; but instead of counting
for everything, as we once did, we don’t seem to
count for anything unless it be dollars and cents.
It isn’t merely that you all talk so fast and have
so much to say without regard to us that we often
feel left out in the cold, and even hurt, but there
is a stern, relentless look on some of your faces
which makes us feel as though we had stolen the
Holy Grail. You must have noticed it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Barbara, with a smile. “It
doesn’t mean very much. Of course times are
not what they were. Man used to be a demigod,
now he is only a&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>Barbara hesitated for a word, so I suggested,
“Only a bank.”</p>

<p>“Let us say only a man. Only a man in the
eyes of reflective womanhood. We have caught
up and are beginning to think for ourselves. You
can’t expect us to hang on your every word and
to fall down and worship you without reservation
as we once did. Man used to be woman’s
whole existence, often to her infinite sorrow, and
now he is only part of it, just as she is only a
part of his. You go to your clubs; we go to ours;
and while you are playing cards we read or listen
to papers, some of which are not intelligible to
man. But we love you still, even though we have
ceased to worship you. There are a few, I admit,
who would like to do away with you altogether;
but they are extremists&mdash;in every revolution,
you know, there are fanatics and unreasonable
persons&mdash;but the vast majority of us have a tender
spot for you in our hearts, and regard your
case in sorrow rather than in anger&mdash;and as
probably not hopeless.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is the matter with us?”</p>

<p>“Oh, everything. You are a failure fundamentally.
To begin with, your theory of life is founded
on compromise. We women&mdash;the modern
woman&mdash;abhor compromise.”</p>

<p>Although it was obvious that Barbara was trying
to tease me, I realized from her expression
that she intended to deal my sex a crucial stab
by the word compromise. I must confess that I
felt just a little uncomfortable under the white
light of scorn which radiated from her eyes, while
her general air reminded me for the first time
disagreeably of the type of modern woman to
whom I had referred.</p>

<p>“The world progresses by compromise,” I
replied, sententiously.</p>

<p>“Yes, like a snail.”</p>

<p>“Otherwise it would stand still. A man thinks
so and so; another man thinks precisely opposite;
they meet each other half-way and so much is
gained.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I know how they do. A man who stands
for a principle meets another man; they argue
and bluster for a few minutes, and presently they
sit down and have something to eat or drink, and
by the time they separate the man who stands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
for a principle has sacrificed all there is of it, except
a tiny scrap or shred, in order not to incommode
the man who has no principles at all;
and what is almost worse, they part seemingly
bosom friends and are apt to exchange rhetorical
protestations of mutual esteem. The modern
woman has no patience with such a way of doing
things.”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” said I, “that two modern women
under similar circumstances would tear each other
all to pieces; there would be nothing to eat or
drink, except possibly tea and wafers, and the
floor would be covered with fragments of skin,
hair, and clothing. When they separated one
would be dead and the other maimed for life, and
the principle for which the victor stood would
be set back about a century and a half.”</p>

<p>Barbara winced a little, but she said, “What
have you men accomplished all these years by
your everlasting compromises? If you were really
in earnest to solve the liquor problem, and the
social evil, as you call it, and all the other
abuses which exist in civilized and uncivilized
society, you would certainly have been able to do
more than you have. You have had free scope;
we haven’t been consulted; we have stood aside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
and let you have your innings; now we merely
wish to see what we can do. We shall make mistakes
I dare say; even one or two of us may be
torn to pieces or maimed for life; but the modern
woman feels that she has the courage of her
convictions and that she does not intend to let
herself be thwarted or cajoled by masculine theories.
That accounts largely for our apparent sniffiness.
I say ‘apparent,’ because we are not really
at bottom so contemptuous as we seem&mdash;even
the worst of us. I suppose you are right in declaring
that the proud, superior, and beautiful
young person of the present day is a little disdainful.
But even she is less severe than she
looks. She is simply a nineteenth-century Joan
of Arc protesting against the man of the world
and his works, asking to be allowed to lead her
life without molestation from him in a shrine of
her own tasteful yet simple construction&mdash;rooms
or a room where she can practise her calling, follow
her tastes, ambitions, or hobbies, pursue her
charities, and amuse herself without being accountable
to him. She wishes him to understand
that, though she is attractive, she does not mean
to be seduced or to be worried into matrimony
against her will, and that she intends to use her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
earnings and her property to pay her own bills
and provide for her own gratification, instead of
to defray the debts of her vicious or easy-going
male relations or admirers. There is really a long
back account to settle, so it is not surprising that
the pendulum should swing a little too far the
other way. Of course she is wrong; woman can
no more live wholly independent of man than
he of her&mdash;and you know what a helpless being
he would be without her&mdash;and the modern woman
is bound to recognize, sooner or later, that
the sympathetic companionship of women with
men is the only basis of true social progress.
Sexual affinity is stronger than the constitutions
of all the women’s clubs combined, as eight out
of ten young modern women discover to their
cost, or rather to their happiness, sooner or later.
Some brute of a man breaks into the shrine, and
before she knows it she is wheeling a baby carriage.
Even the novelist, with his or her fertile
invention, has failed to discover any really satisfactory
ending for the independent, disdainful
heroine but marriage or the grave. Spinsterhood,
even when illumined by a career, is a worthy and
respectable lot, but not alluring.”</p>

<p>It was something to be assured by my wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
that the modern woman does not purpose to
abolish either maternity or men, and that, so to
speak, her bark is worse than her bite. Barbara
belongs to a woman’s club, so she must know.
We men are in such a nervous state, as a result
of what Barbara calls the revolution, that very
likely we are unduly sensitive and suspicious, and
allow our imaginations to fly off at a tangent.
Very likely, too, we are disposed to be a trifle irritable,
for when one has been accustomed for
long to sit on or club a person (literally or metaphorically,
according to one’s social status) when
she happens to express sentiments or opinions
contrary to ours, it must needs take time to get
used to the idea that she is really an equal, and
to adjust one’s ratiocinations to suit. But even
accepting as true the assurance that the forbidding
air of the modern woman does not mean
much, and that she loves us still though she has
ceased to worship us, we have Barbara’s word for
it, too, that the modern woman thinks we have
made a mess of it and that man is a failure fundamentally.
Love without respect! Sorrow rather
than anger! It sobers one; it saddens one. For
we must admit that man has had free scope and
a long period in which to make the most of himself;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
and woman has not, which precludes us from
answering back, as it were, which is always more
or less of a consolation when one is brought to
bay.</p>

<p>A tendency to compromise is certainly one of
man’s characteristics. Barbara has referred to it
as a salient fault&mdash;a vice, and perhaps it is,
though it is writ large in the annals of civilization
as conducted by man. We must at least
agree that it is not woman’s way, and that she
expects to do without it when we are no more or
are less than we are now. Probably we have been
and are too easy-going, and no one will deny that
one ought at all times to have the courage of
one’s convictions, even in midsummer and on
purely social occasions; nevertheless it would
have been trying to the nervous system and conducive
to the continuance and increase of standing
armies, had we favored the policy of shooting
at sight those whose views on the temperance
question differed from ours, or of telling the host
at whose house we had passed the evening that
we had been bored to death.</p>

<p>If one runs over in his mind the Madame
Tussaud Gallery of masculine types, he cannot
fail to acknowledge that, in our capacity of lords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
of creation and viceregents of Providence, we
have produced and perpetuated a number of
sorry specimens. First in the list stands the so-called
man of the world, on account of whom in
particular, according to Barbara, the nineteenth-century
Joan of Arc looks askance at our sex.
He is an old stager; he dates back very nearly,
if not completely, to the garden of Eden, and he
has always been a bugbear to woman. It is not
necessary to describe him; he has ever stood for
simply carnal interests and appetites, whether as
a satyr, a voluptuary, a wine-bibber, a glutton,
a miser, an idler, or a mere pleasure-seeker. If all
the human industries which have owed and still
owe their prosperity to his propensities were to
be obliterated, there would be a large array of
unemployed in the morning but a healthier
world. The bully, or prevailer by brute force, the
snob, the cynic, the parasite, the trimmer, and
the conceited egotist are others prominent in the
category, without regard to criminals and unvarnished
offenders against whose noxious behavior
men have protected themselves by positive law.</p>

<p>On the other hand, our gallery of past types
has many figures of which we have a right to be
proud. Unfortunately we are barred again from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
comparison or answering back by the taunt that
woman has never had a chance; nevertheless we
may claim for what it is worth that, in the realm
of intellect or of the spirit, there have been no
women who have soared so high; seers, poets,
law-givers, unfolders of nature’s secrets, administrators
of affairs, healers and scholars have been
chiefly or solely men. If some of us have fraternized
with Belial, others have walked, or sought
to walk, with God no less genuinely and fervently
than any woman who ever breathed. In the matter
of spirituality, indeed, some of us in the past
having been led to believe that women knew
more about the affairs of the other world than
men, sought to cultivate the spindle-legged,
thin-chested, pale, anæmic Christian as the type
of humanity most acceptable to God and serviceable
to society; but we have gone back to
the bishop of sturdy frame and a reasonably
healthy appetite as a more desirable mediator
between ourselves and heaven.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of our present inquiry,
what man in his various types has been in the
past is less pertinent than what he is at present.
To begin with, certainly the modern man is not
a picturesque figure. He no longer appeals to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
feminine or any eye by virtue of imposing apparel
or accoutrements. Foreign army officers
and servants in livery are almost the only males
who have not exchanged plumage for sober
woollens, tweeds, or serges, and the varied resplendent
materials and colors by means of
which men used to distinguish themselves from
one another and to negative their evil-doings in
the eyes of women have been discarded. All men
but one look alike to any woman, and even that
one is liable to be confounded with the rest of
mankind when he is more than half a block away.</p>

<p>Nor is the homogeneous tendency limited to
clothes; it includes manners, morals, and point
of view. The extreme types approximate each
other much more closely than formerly, and apart
from criminals and deliberately evil-minded persons,
women have some ground for their insinuation
that we are all pretty much alike. Let it be
said that this effect is in one sense a feather in
our caps. The nineteenth-century Joan of Arc
to the contrary notwithstanding, the modern man
of the world is a manifest improvement on his
predecessor. He is no longer to be found under
the table after dinner as a social matter of course,
and three-bottles-to-a-guest festivities have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
ceased to be an aristocratic function. Though on
occasions still he will fumble with the latch-key,
he mounts the stairs very little, if at all, after
midnight with the nonchalance of self-congratulatory
sobriety, and all those dire scenes of woman
on the staircase with a lighted candle looking
down at her prostrate lord and master belong to
an almost dim past. True it may be that the man
of the world fears God no more than formerly,
but he has learned to have a wholesome dread
of Bright’s disease, the insane asylum, and those
varied forms of sudden and premature death
which are included under the reportorial head
of heart-failure. Mere brutishness in its various
forms is less apparent. The coarse materialist still
swaggers in public places and impudently puffs
a cigar in the face of modesty, but he serves no
longer as a model for envious contemporaries or
an object of hero-worship to the rising generation.
Good taste, if nothing better, has checked
man’s tendencies to make a beast of himself in
public or in private.</p>

<p>Similarly, also, the type of man to whom we
look up most proudly and confidently to-day is
not altogether the same. The model whom we
were urged, and whom we sought of old to imitate,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
was he who wrestled with God on the
mountain-top, without a thought of earth’s
smoke and din and wretchedness. Human life
and its joys and interests served for him as a
homily on vanity, or was regarded as a degradation
in comparison with the revelations obtained
by the priest, poet, or devotee of culture
through the vista of aspiring imagination or zeal.
The conservative man of affairs&mdash;vigorous, far-seeing,
keenly alive to the joys and interests of
this life, strongly sympathetic on the humanitarian
side, a man of the world withal in a reasonable
sense&mdash;has impressed his personality on
modern society more successfully than any other
type. The priest who cares not for his fellow-man,
the poet whose dreams and visions include no
human interest or passion, the devotee of culture
who refines merely to refine, have been superseded,
and in their stead we have the man of the
world who is interested in the world and for the
world.</p>

<p>This change in the avowed aims and aspirations
of man has not been without certain apparently
melancholy results and manifestations of
which society is feeling the effect at present, and
which if allowed to prevail too far will undo us.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
The removal of the gaze of the priest, poet, and
devotee of culture from the stars in contempt of
earth, and the substitution of earth-gazing as a
method for understanding the stars, has seemed
to cast a damper on human imagination and has
thereby caused many excellent women and some
men to weep. If materialism be the science of
trying to get the most out of this life, this is a
material age; but at the same time it should be
remembered that man in this age has ceased for
the first time to be either a hypocrite or a fool.
Undoubtedly the process of becoming both sincere
and sensible, especially as it has substituted
concern for the ignorant, the oppressed, and the
vicious of this earth about whom we know next
to nothing, in place of Pre-Raphaelite heavenly
choirs, alabaster halls, and saints in glory about
whom we thought we knew everything, has been
a little trying for the rest of us as well as for the
priests, poets, and devotees of culture. But the
women must not be discouraged; we shall grow
to the situation in time, and even the poets, who
seem to be most down in the mouth at present,
will sooner or later find a fresh well of inspiration
by learning to study the reflection of the stars on
the earth instead of looking directly at them. Let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
them be patient, though it be to death, and some
day through others, if not through themselves,
the immortal verse will flow and the immortal
lyre sound again.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the modern man is at present a
rather trying person to woman, for woman would
have been glad, now that she is coming into
her kingdom, to have him more of a crusader
and less of a philosopher. To behold him lacking
in picturesqueness and a philosopher addicted
to compromise into the bargain is almost
irritating to her, and she has certainly some
ground for criticism. The man who sits opposite
to her at the breakfast-table, even after he
has overcome conservative fears of nothing to
live on and dawdled into matrimony, is a lovable
but not especially exciting person. He eats,
works, and sleeps, does most of the things which
he ought to do and leaves undone a commendable
number of the things which he ought not to
do, and is a rather respectable member of society
of the machine-made order. He works very hard
to supply her with money; he is kind to her and
the children; he gives her her head, as he calls
it; and he acquiesces pleasantly enough in the
social plans which she entertains for herself and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
him, and ordinarily he is sleepy in the evening.
Indeed, in moments of most serious depression
she is tempted to think of him as a superior
chore-man, a comparison which haunts her even
in church. She would like, with one fell swoop
of her broom, to clear the world of the social
evil, the fruit of the grape, tobacco, and playing
cards, to introduce drastic educational reforms
which would, by kindergarten methods, familiarize
every one on earth with art and culture, and
to bring to pass within five, or possibly six years,
a golden age of absolute reform inspired and established
by woman. Life for her at present
means one vast camp of committee meetings,
varied only by frequent cups of tea; and that
steaming beverage continues prominent in her
radiant vision of the coming millennium. No
wonder it disconcerts and annoys her to find so
comparatively little enthusiastic confidence in
the immediate success of her fell swoop, and to
have her pathway blocked by grave or lazy ifs
and buts and by cold contradictions of fact. No
wonder she abhors compromise; no wonder she
regards the man who goes on using tobacco and
playing cards and drinking things stronger than
tea as an inert and soulless creature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet smile as we may at the dull, sorry place
the world would be were the golden age of her
intention to come upon us over night like a cold
wave, is she not justified in regarding the average
custom-made man of the day as a highly
respectable, well-to-do chore-man who earns fair
wages and goes to sleep at night contented with
a good meal and a pipe? Is he not machine-made?
Sincere and wise as he is, now that his
gaze is fixed on the needs of earth, has he not
the philosophy of hygienic comfort and easy-going
conservative materialism so completely on
the brain that he is in danger of becoming ordinary
instead of just a little lower than the angels?
Let us consider him from this point of
view more in detail.</p>

<h2>The <i>Case of Man</i>.</h2>

<h3>II.</h3>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t-2.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The young man of the present era
on his twenty-first birthday is apt to
find himself in a very prudent and
conservative atmosphere. The difficulties
of getting on are explained to him; he
is properly assured that, though there is plenty
of room on the top benches, the occupations
and professions are crowded, if not overcrowded,
and that he must buckle down if he would succeed.
It is obvious to him that the field of adventure
and fortune-seeking in foreign or strange
places is practically exhausted. It is open to him,
to be sure, to go to the North Pole in search of
some one already there, or to study in a cage in
the jungles of Africa the linguistic value of the
howls and chatterings of wild animals; but these
are manifestly poor pickings compared with the
opportunities of the past when a considerable
portion of the globe was still uninvestigated soil,
and a reputation or treasure-trove was the tolerably
frequent reward of leaving the rut of civilized
life. It is plainly pointed out to him, too,
that to be florid is regarded as almost a mental<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
weakness in intellectual or progressive circles.
He sees the lawyer who makes use of metaphor,
bombast, and the other arts of oratory, which
used to captivate and convince, distanced in the
race for eminence by him who employs a succinct,
dispassionate, and almost colloquial form
of statement. He recognizes that in every department
of human activity, from the investigation
of disease-germs to the management of railroads,
steady, undemonstrative marshallings of
fact, and cautious, unemotional deduction therefrom
are considered the scientific and only appropriate
method. He knows that the expression
of unusual or erratic ideas will expose him to the
stigma of being a crank, a reputation which, once
acquired, sticks like pitch, and that the betrayal
of sentiment will induce conservative people to
put him on the suspected list.</p>

<p>All this is imbibed by him as it should be, in the
interest of sincerity and sense. Under the sobering
restraint of it the young man begins to make his
way with enthusiasm and energy, but circumspectly
and deliberately. He mistrusts everything
that he cannot pick to pieces on the spot and analyze,
and though he is willing to be amused, beguiled,
or even temporarily inspired by appeals to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
his imagination or emotions, he puts his doubts or
qualms aside next morning at the behest of business.
He wishes to get on. He is determined not
to allow anything to interfere with that, and he
understands that that is to be accomplished partly
by hard work and partly by becoming a good fellow
and showing common-sense. This is excellent
reasoning until one examines too closely what is
expected of him as a good fellow, and what is required
of him in the name of common-sense.</p>

<p>There have been good fellows in every age,
and some of them have been tough specimens.
Our good fellow is almost highly respectable. He
wishes to live as long as he can, and to let others
live as long as they can. His patron saints are
his doctor, his bank account, prudence, and general
toleration. If he were obliged to specify the
vice not covered by the statute law which he
most abhors, he would probably name slopping
over. He aims to be genial, sympathetic, and
knowing, but not obtrusively so, and he is becomingly
suspicious and reticent regarding everything
which cannot be demonstrated on a chart
like an international yacht-race or a medical operation.
He is quietly and moderately licentious,
and justifies himself satisfactorily but mournfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
on hygienic grounds or on the plea of masculine
inevitability. He works hard, if he has to, for he
wishes to live comfortably by the time he is forty,
and comfort means, as it ought to mean, an attractive
wife, an attractive establishment, and an attractive
income. An imprudent marriage seems
to him one of the most egregious forms of slopping
over. If he hears that two of his contemporaries
are engaged, his first inquiry is, “What
have they to live on?” and if the answer is unsatisfactory,
they fall a peg or two in his estimation,
and he is likely, the next time he feels mellow
after dinner, to descant on the impropriety
of bringing children into the world who may be
left penniless orphans. If he falls in love himself
before he feels that his pecuniary position warrants
it, he tries to shake out the arrow, and, if
that fails, he cuts it out deliberately under antiseptic
treatment to avoid blood-poisoning. All our
large cities are full of young men who have undergone
this operation. To lose one’s vermiform
appendix is a perilous yet blessed experience; but
this trifling with the human heart, however scientific
the excision, can scarcely be regarded as beneficial
unless we are to assume that it, like the
fashionable sac, has become rudimentary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span></p>

<p>We see a great many allusions in our comic
and satiric weeklies to marrying for money, but
the good fellow of the best type ordinarily disdains
such a proceeding. His self-respect is not
offended but hugely gratified if the young woman
with whom he intends to ally himself would
be able immediately or prospectively to contribute
a million or so to the domestic purse; but
he would regard a deliberate sale of himself for
cash as a dirty piece of business. On the other
hand, he is very business-like where his heart is
engaged, and is careful not to let his emotions or
fancy get the better of him until he can see his
ship&mdash;and a well-freighted one at that&mdash;on the
near horizon. And what is to become of the
young woman in the meantime? To let concealment,
like a worm in the bud, feed on a damask
cheek may be more fatal than masculine arrow
extraction; for woman, less scientific in her methods
than man, is less able to avoid blood-poisoning.
She doses herself, probably, with anti-pyrine,
burns her Emerson and her Tennyson,
and after a period of nervous prostration devotes
herself to charity toward the world at large with
the exception of all good fellows.</p>

<p>The good fellow after he marries continues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
to be a good fellow. He adapts himself to the
humanitarian necessities of the situation; he becomes
fond and domestic, almost oppressively
so, and he is eager to indulge the slightest wish
or fancy of his mate, provided it be within the
bounds of easy-going rationalism. The conjugal
pliability of the American husband is a well-recognized
original feature of our institutions,
nevertheless he is apt to develop kinks unless he
be allowed to be indulgent and companionable
in his own way. He works harder than ever, and
she for whose sake he is ostensibly toiling is encouraged
to make herself fetching and him comfortable
as progressively as his income will permit.
When the toil of the week is over he looks
for his reward in the form of a Welsh-rarebit
with theatrical celebrities, a little game of poker
within his means, or, if he be musical, a small
gathering of friends to sing or play, if possible
in a so-called Bohemian spirit. It irks him to
stand very upright or to converse for long,
whether in masculine or feminine society. He
likes to sprawl and to be entertained with the
latest bit of humor, but he is willing, on a pleasant
Sunday or holiday, to take exercise in order
to perspire freely, and then to lie at ease under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
a tree or a bank, pleasantly refreshed with beer
and tobacco, and at peace with the world. He
prefers to have her with him everywhere, except
at the little game of poker, and is conscious of
an aching void if she be not at hand to help him
recuperate, philosophize, and admire the view.
But he expects her to do what he likes, and expects
her to like it too.</p>

<p>In no age of the world has the reasoning power
of man been in better working order than at
present. With all due respect to the statistics
which show that the female is beginning to outstrip
the male in academic competitive examinations,
one has only to keep his ears and eyes open
in the workaday world in order to be convinced
that man’s purely mental processes suggest a razor
and woman’s a corkscrew. The manager of
corporate interests, the lawyer, the historian, the
physician, the chemist, and the banker seek to-day
to probe to the bottom that which they
touch, and to expose to the acid of truth every
rosy theory and seductive prospectus. This is in
the line of progress; but to be satisfied with this
alone would speedily reduce human society to
the status of a highly organized racing stable.
If man is to be merely a jockey, who is to ride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
as light as he can, there is nothing to be said;
but even on that theory is it not possible to train
too fine? With eloquence tabooed as savoring
of insincerity, with conversation as a fine art
starved to death, with melody in music sniffed
at as sensational, and fancy in literature condemned
as unscientific, with the loosening of all
the bonds of conventionality which held civilization
to the mark in matters of taste and elegance,
and with a general doing away with color
and emotion in all the practical affairs of life out
of regard to the gospel of common-sense and machine-made
utility, the jockey now is riding practically
in his own skin.</p>

<p>One has to go back but a little way in order
to encounter among the moving spirits of society
a radically different attitude. Unquestionably the
temper of the present day is the result of a vigorous
reaction against false or maudlin sentiment,
florid drivel, and hypocritical posturing; but certainly
a Welsh-rarebit at midnight, with easy-going
companions, is a far remove as a spiritual
stimulus from bread eaten in tears at the same
hour. As has been intimated, this exaggeration
of commonplaceness will probably right itself in
time, but man’s lack of susceptibility to influences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
and impressions which cannot be weighed,
fingered, smelt, looked at, or tasted, seems to
justify at present the strictures of the modern
woman, who, with all her bumptiousness, would
fain continue to reverence him. Some in the van
of feminine progress would be glad to see the
inspiration and direction of all matters&mdash;spiritual,
artistic, and social&mdash;apportioned to woman
as her sole rightful prerogative, and consequently
to see man become veritably a superior chore-man.
Fortunately the world of men and women
is likely to agree with Barbara that mutual sympathy
and co-operation in these matters between
the sexes are indispensable to the healthy development
of human society.</p>

<p>But even assuming that women were ready to
accept the responsibility and men were willing
to renounce it, I, for one, fear that civilization
would find itself in a ditch rather speedily. All
of us&mdash;we men, I mean&mdash;recognize the purifying
and deterrent influence of woman as a Mentor
and sweet critic at our elbows. We have
learned to depend upon her to prod us when we
lag, and to save us from ourselves when our
brains get the better of our hearts. But, after all,
woman is a clinging creature. She has been used<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
to playing second fiddle; and it is quite a different
affair to lead an orchestra. To point the way
to spiritual or artistic progress needs, first of all,
a clear intellect and a firm purpose, even though
they alone are not sufficient. Woman is essentially
yielding and impressionable. At the very
moment when the modern Joan of Arc would
be doing her best to make the world a better
place, would not eleven other women out of the
dozen be giving way to the captivating plausibility
of some emotional situation?</p>

<p>As an instance of what she is already capable
of from a social point of view, now that she has
been given her head, may well be cited the feverish
eagerness with which some of the most highly
cultivated and most subtly evolved American
women of our large cities vie with each other for
intimacy with artistic foreign lions of their own
sex known to be unchaste. They seem to regard
it as a privilege to play hostess to, or, at least,
to be on familiar terms with, actresses, opera-singers,
and other public characters quietly but
notoriously erotic, the plea in each case being
that they are ready to forgive, to forget, and ignore
for the sake of art and the artist. Yes, ignore
or forget, if you choose, so far as seeing the artist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
act or hearing her sing in public is concerned,
where there are no social ceremonies or intercourse;
but let us please remember at the same
time that even those effete nations who believe
that the world would be a dull place without
courtesans, insist on excluding such persons
from their drawing-rooms. Indeed there is reason
to believe that some of the artists in question
have become hilarious, when out of sight
of our hospitable shores, over the wonders of
American social usages among the pure and cultivated
women. Before our young men will cease
to sow wild oats their female relations must
cease to run after other men’s mistresses. Decidedly,
the modern Joan of Arc to the contrary
notwithstanding, man cannot afford to abdicate
just yet. But he needs to mend his hedges and
to look after his preserves.</p>

<h2>The <i>Case of Woman</i>.</h2>

<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-a-3.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">A great many men, who are
sane and reasonable in other
matters, allow themselves, on
the slightest provocation, to be
worked up into a fever over the
aspirations of woman. They decline to listen to
argument, grow red in the face, and saw the air
with their hands, if they do not pound on the
table, to express their views on the subject&mdash;which,
by the way, are as out of date and old-fashioned
as a pine-tree shilling. They remind
one of the ostrich in that they seem to imagine,
because they have buried their heads in the sand,
nothing has happened or is happening around
them. They confront the problem of woman’s
emancipation as though it were only just being
broached instead of in the throes of delivery.</p>

<p>For instance, my friend, Mr. Julius Cæsar, who
though a conservative, cautious man by nature, is
agreeably and commendably liberal in other matters,
seems to be able to see only one side of this
question. And one side seems to be all he wishes
to see. “Take my wife,” he said to me the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
day; “as women go she is a very clever and sensible
woman. She was given the best advantages in
the way of school-training open to young ladies of
her day; she has accomplishments, domestic virtues,
and fine religious instincts, and I adore her.
But what does she know of politics? She couldn’t
tell you the difference between a senator and an
alderman, and her mind is practically a blank on
the tariff or the silver question. I tell you, my dear
fellow, that if woman is allowed to leave the domestic
hearth and play ducks and drakes with the
right of suffrage, every political caucus will become
a retail drygoods store. If there is one thing which
makes a philosopher despair of the future of the
race, it is to stand in a crowded drygoods store
and watch the jam of women perk and push and
sidle and grab and covet and go well-nigh crazy
over things to wear. The average woman knows
about clothes, the next world, children, and her
domestic duties. Let her stick to her sphere. A
woman at a caucus? Who would see that my dinner
was properly cooked, eh?”</p>

<p>One would suppose from these remarks that
the male American citizen spends his days
chiefly at caucuses; whereas, as we all know when
we reflect, he goes perhaps twice a year, if he be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
a punctilious patriot like Julius Cæsar, and if not,
probably does not go at all. If the consciousness
that his wife could vote at a caucus would act as
a spur to the masculine political conscience, the
male American citizen could well afford to dine
at a restaurant on election-days, or to cook his
own food now and then.</p>

<p>Of course, even a man with views like Julius
Cæsar would be sorry to have his wife the slavish,
dollish, or unenlightened individual which
she was apt to be before so-called women’s rights
were heard of. As he himself has proclaimed,
he adores his wife, and he is, moreover, secretly
proud of her æsthetic presentability. Without
being an advanced woman, Dolly Cæsar has the
interests of the day and hour at her fingers’ ends,
can talk intelligently on any subject, whether she
knows anything about it or not, and is decidedly
in the van, though she is not a leader. Julius
does not take into account, when he anathematizes
the sex because of its ambitions, the difference
between her and her great-grandmother.
He believes his wife to be a very charming specimen
of what a woman ought to be, and that,
barring a few differences of costume and hair arrangement,
she is practically her great-grandmother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
over again. Fatuous Julius! There is
where he is desperately in error. Dolly Cæsar’s
great-grandmother may have been a radiant
beauty and a famous housekeeper, but her brain
never harbored one-tenth of the ideas and opinions
which make her descendant so attractive.</p>

<p>Those who argue on this matter like Julius
Cæsar fail to take into account the gradual, silent
results of time; and this is true of the results to
come as well as those which have accrued. When
the suffrage question is mooted one often hears
sober men, more dispassionate men than Julius&mdash;Perkins,
for instance, the thin, nervous lawyer
and father of four girls, and a sober man
indeed&mdash;ask judicially whether it is possible for
female suffrage to be a success when not one
woman in a thousand would know what was expected
of her, or how to vote. “I tell you,” says
Perkins, “they are utterly unfitted for it by training
and education. Four-fifths of them wouldn’t
vote if they were allowed to, and every one
knows that ninety-nine women out of every
hundred are profoundly ignorant of the matters
in regard to which they would cast their ballots.
Take my daughters; fine girls, talented, intelligent
women&mdash;one of them a student of history;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
but what do they know of parties, and platforms,
and political issues in general?”</p>

<p>Perkins is less violently prejudiced than Julius
Cæsar. He neither saws the air nor pounds on
the table. Indeed, I have no doubt he believes
that he entertains liberal, unbiassed views on the
subject. I wonder, then, why it never occurs to
him that everything which is new is adopted
gradually, and that the world has to get accustomed
to all novel situations. I happened to see
Mr. Perkins the first time he rode a bicycle on
the road, and his performance certainly justified
the prediction that he would look like a guy to
the end of his days, and yet he glides past me
now with the ease and nonchalance of a possible
“scorcher.” Similarly, if women were given universal
suffrage, there would be a deal of fluttering
in the dove-cotes for the first generation or so.
Doubtless four-fifths of womankind would refuse
or neglect to vote at all, and at least a quarter
of those who went to the polls would cast their
ballots as tools or blindly. But just so soon as it
was understood that it was no less a woman’s
duty to vote than it was to attend to her back
hair, she would be educated from that point of
view, and her present crass ignorance of political<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
matters would be changed into at least a form of
enlightenment. Man prides himself on his logic,
but there is nothing logical in the argument that
because a woman knows nothing about anything
now, she can never be taught. If we have been
content to have her remain ignorant for so many
centuries, does it not savor both of despotism and
lack of reasonableness to cast her ignorance in
her teeth and to beat her about the head with
it now that she is eager to rise? Decidedly it is
high time for the man who orates tempestuously
or argues dogmatically in the name of conservatism
against the cause of woman on such flimsy
pleas as these, to cease his gesticulations and wise
saws. The modern woman is a potential reality,
who is bound to develop and improve, in another
generation or two, as far beyond the present
interesting type as Mrs. Julius Cæsar is an
advance on her great-grandmother.</p>

<p>On the other hand, why do those who have
woman’s cause at heart lay such formal stress on
the right of the ballot as a factor in her development?
There can be no doubt that, if the majority
of women wish to vote on questions involving
property or political interests, they will
be enabled to do so sooner or later. It is chiefly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
now the conviction in the minds of legislatures
that a large number of the intelligent women of
their communities do not desire to exercise the
right of suffrage which keeps the bars down.
Doubtless these bodies will yield one after another
to the clamor of even a few, and the experiment
will be tried. It may not come this year
or the next, but many busy people are so certain
that its coming is merely a question of time
that they do not allow themselves to be drawn
into the fury of the fray. When it comes, however,
it will come as a universal privilege, and
not with a social or property qualification. I mention
this simply for the enlightenment of those
amiable members of the sex to be enfranchised
who go about sighing and simpering in the interest
of drawing the line. That question was
settled a century ago. The action taken may have
been an error on the part of those who framed
the laws, but it has been settled forever. There
would be no more chance of the passage by the
legislature of one of the United States of a statute
giving the right of suffrage to a limited class of
women than there would be of one prescribing
that only the good-looking members of that sex
should be allowed to marry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>Many people, who believe that woman should
be denied no privilege enjoyed by man which she
really desires to exercise, find much difficulty in
regarding the right of suffrage as the vital end
which it assumes in the minds of its advocates.
One would suppose, by the clamor on the subject,
that the ballot would enable her to change her
spots in a twinkling, and to become an absolutely
different creation. Lively imaginations do not
hesitate to compare the proposed act of emancipation
with the release of the colored race from
bondage. We are appealed to by glowing rhetoric
which celebrates the equity of the case and
the moral significance of the impending victory.
But the orators and triumphants stop short at the
passage of the law and fail to tell us what is to
come after. We are assured, indeed, that it will
be all right, and that woman’s course after the
Rubicon is crossed will be one grand march of
progress to the music of the spheres; but, barring
a pæan of this sort, we are given no light as
to what she intends to do and become. She has
stretched out her hand for the rattle and is determined
to have it, but she does not appear to
entertain any very definite ideas as to what she
is going to do with it after she has it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>

<p>Unquestionably, the development of the modern
woman is one of the most interesting features
of civilization to-day. But is it not true that the
cause of woman is one concern, and the question
of woman suffrage another? And are they not too
often confounded, even deliberately confounded,
by those who are willing to have them appear
to be identical? Supposing that to-morrow the
trumpet should sound and the walls of Jericho
fall, and every woman be free to cast her individual
ballot without let or hindrance from one
confine of the civilized world to another, what
would it amount to after all by way of elucidating
the question of her future evolution? For it must
be remembered that, apart from the question of
her development in general, those who are clamoring
for the ballot have been superbly vague so
far as to the precise part which the gentle sex is
to play in the political arena after she gets her
rattle. They put their sisters off with the general
assertion that things in the world, politically
speaking, will be better, but neither their sisters
nor their brothers are able to get a distinct notion
of the platform on which woman means to stand
after she becomes a voter. Is she going to enter
into competition with men for the prizes and offices,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
to argue, manipulate, hustle, and do generally
the things which have to be done in the
name of political zeal and activity? Is it within
the vista of her ambition to become a member of,
and seek to control, legislative bodies, to be a
police commissioner or a member of Congress?
Those in the van decline to answer, or at least
they do not answer. It may be, to be sure, the
wisdom of the serpent which keeps them non-committal,
for they stand, as it were, between the
devil and the deep sea in that, though they and
their supporters would perhaps like to declare
boldly in favor of competition, or at least participation,
in the duties and honors, they stand
in wholesome awe of the hoarse murmur from
the ranks of their sisters, “We don’t wish to be
like men, and we have no intention of competing
with them on their own lines.” Accordingly, the
leaders seek refuge in the safe but indefinite assertion
that of course women will never become
men, but they have thus far neglected to tell us
what they are to become.</p>

<p>It really seems as though it were time for woman,
in general congress of the women’s clubs
assembled, to make a reasonably full and clear
statement of her aims and principles&mdash;a declaration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
of faith which shall give her own sex and
men the opportunity to know precisely what she
is driving at. Her progress for the last hundred
years has been gratifying to the world, with the
exception of pig-headed or narrow-minded men,
and civilization has been inestimably benefitted
by the broadening of her intelligence and her interests.
But she has now reached a point where
there is a parting of the ways, and the world
would very much like to know which she intends
to take. The atmosphere of the women’s
clubs is mysterious but unsuggestive, and consequently
many of us feel inclined to murmur
with the poet, “it is clever, but we don’t know
what it means.” Unrepressed nervous mental
activity easily becomes social affectation or tomfoolery,
in the absence of a controlling aim or
purpose. To exhaust one’s vitality in papers or
literary teas, merely to express or simulate individual
culture or freedom, may not land one in
an insane asylum, but it is about as valuable to
society, as an educating force, as the revolutions
of the handle of a freezer, when the crank is off,
are valuable to the production of ice-cream. For
the benefit of such a congress, if haply it should
be called together later, it will not be out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
place to offer a few suggestions as to her future
evolution. In this connection it seems to me imperative
to go back to the original poetic conception
of woman as the wife and mother, the
domestic helpmate and loving, self-abnegating
companion of man. Unedifying as this formula
of description may seem to the active-minded
modern woman, it is obvious that under existing
physiological conditions she must remain
the wife and mother, even though she declines
to continue domestic, loving, and self-abnegating.
And side by side with physiological conditions
stands the intangible, ineffable force of
sexual love, the poetic, entrancing ecstasy which
no scientist has yet been able to reduce to a
myth or to explode. Schopenhauer, to be sure,
would have us believe that it is merely a delusion
by which nature seeks to reproduce herself, but
even on this material basis the women’s clubs
find themselves face to face with an enemy more
determined than any Amazon. A maid deluded
becomes the sorriest of club members.</p>

<p>What vision of life is nobler and more exquisite
than that of complete and ideal marital happiness?
To find it complete and ideal the modern
woman, with all her charms and abilities,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
must figure in it, I grant; the mere domestic
drudge; the tame, amiable house-cat; the doting
doll, are no longer pleasing parties of the second
part. To admit so much as this may seem to offer
room for the argument that the modern woman
of a hundred years hence will make her of
the poet’s dream of to-day appear no less pitiable;
but there we men are ready to take issue.
We admit our past tyranny, we cry “Peccavi,”
yet we claim at the same time that, having taken
her to our bosoms as our veritable, loving companion
and helpmate, there is no room left, or
very little room left, for more progress in that
particular direction. Her next steps, if taken, will
be on new lines, not by way of making herself
an equal. And therefore it is that we suggest the
vision of perfect modern marital happiness as
the leading consideration to be taken into account
in dealing with this question. Even in the
past, when woman was made a drudge and encouraged
to remain a fool, the poetry and joy and
stimulus of life for her, as well as for her despot
mate, lay in the mystery of love, its joys and responsibilities.
Even then, if her life were robbed
of the opportunity to love and be loved, its savor
was gone, however free she might be from masculine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
tyranny and coercion. Similarly, after
making due allowance for the hyperbole as to
the influence which woman has on man when he
has made up his mind to act to the contrary,
there is no power which works for righteousness
upon him comparable to the influence of
woman. There is always the possibility that the
woman a man loves may not be consciously
working for righteousness, but the fact that he
believes so is the essential truth, even though
he be the victim of self-delusion. This element
of the case is pertinent to the question whether
woman would really try to reform the world, if
she had the chance, rather than to this particular
consideration. The point of the argument is
that the dependence of each sex on the other,
and the loving sympathy between them, which
is born of dissimilarity, is the salt of human life.
The eternal feminine is what we prize in woman,
and wherever she deflects from this there does
her power wane and her usefulness become impaired.
And conversely, the more and the higher
she advances along the lines of her own nature,
the better for the world. Nor does the claim that
she has been hampered hitherto, and consequently
been unable to show what her attributes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
really are, seem relevant; for it is only when she
develops in directions which threaten to clash
with the eternal feminine that she encounters
opposition or serious criticism. And here even
the excitability and unreasonableness of such
men as our friend Julius Cæsar find a certain justification.
Their fumes and fury, however unintelligent,
proceed from an instinctive repugnance
to the departure or deviation from nature which
they find, or fear to find, in the modern woman.
Once let them realize that there was no danger
of anything of the kind, and they would become
gentle as doves, if not all smiles and approval.</p>

<p>There is no more beautiful and refining influence
in the world than that of an attractive and
noble woman. Unselfishness, tenderness, aspiring
sentiment, long-suffering devotion, grace,
tact, and quickly divining intelligence are her
prerogatives, and she stands an ever-watchful
guardian angel at the shoulder of man. The leading
poetic and elevating associations of life are
linked with her name. The lover’s passion, the
husband’s worship, the son’s reverential affection
are inspired by her. The strong man stays his
hand and sides with mercy or honor when his
mother speaks within him. In homelier language,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
she is the keeper of the hearth and home, the
protector and trainer of her children, the adviser,
consoler, and companion of her husband, father,
son, brother, or other masculine associates.</p>

<p>Now, the modern woman, up to this point,
has been disposed, on the whole, to regard this
as the part which she is to play in the drama of
life. At least she has not materially deviated from
it. Her progress has been simply in the way of
enabling her to play that part more intelligently
and worthily, and not toward usurpation, excepting
that she claims the right to earn her daily
bread. Higher education in its various branches
has been the most signal fruit of her struggle for
enlightenment and liberty, and this is certainly
in entire keeping with the eternal feminine, and
to-day seems indispensable to her suitable development.
By means of education similar to
that lavished upon man she has been enabled, it
is true, to obtain employment of various kinds
hitherto withheld from her, but the positions of
professor, teacher, nurse, artist, and clerk, are
amplifications of her natural aptitudes rather than
encroachments. She has, however, finally reached
the stage where she will soon have to decide whether
the hearth and the home or down-town is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
be the principal theatre of her activity and influence.
Is she or is she not to participate with man
in the tangible, obvious management of the affairs
of the world?</p>

<h2>The <i>Case of Woman</i>.</h2>

<h3>II.</h3>

</div>

<div>
<img class="dropcap" src="images/dropcap-t-3.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The mystic oracles of the women’s
clubs do not give a straightforward
answer to this question. Yet there are
mutterings, mouthings, and signs
from them which tend to arouse masculine suspicions.
To use a colloquialism, woman fancies
herself very much at present, and she spends considerable
time in studying the set of her mind in
the looking-glass. And her serenity is justified.
In spite of ridicule, baiting, and delay for several
generations, she has demonstrated her ability and
fitness to do a number of things which we had
adjudged her incapable of doing. She can almost
take care of herself in the street after dark. She
has become a most valuable member of committees
to ameliorate the condition of the poor, the
sick, and the insane. She has become the president
and professors of colleges founded in her
behalf. The noble and numerous army of teachers,
typewriters, salesladies, nurses, and women
doctors (including Christian Scientists), stands
as ample proof of her intention and capacity to
strike out for herself. No wonder, perhaps, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
she is a little delirious and mounted in the head,
and that she is tempted to exclaim, “Go to, I will
do more than this. Why should I not practise
law, and sell stocks, wheat, corn, and exchange,
control the money markets of the world, administer
trusts, manage corporations, sit in Congress,
and be President of the United States?”</p>

<p>The only things now done by man which the
modern woman has not yet begun to cast sheep’s
eyes at are labor requiring much physical strength
and endurance, and military service. She is prepared
to admit that she can never expect to be so
muscular and powerful in body as man. But this
has become rather a solace than a source of perplexity
to her. Indeed, the women’s clubs are
beginning to whisper under their breath, “Man
is fitted to build and hew and cut and lift, and to
do everything which demands brute force. We
are not. We should like to think, plan, and execute.
Let him do the heavy work. If he wishes
to fight he may. Wars are wicked, and we shall
vote against them and refuse to take part in
them.”</p>

<p>If woman is going in for this sort of thing, of
course she needs the ballot. If she intends to
manage corporations and do business generally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
she ought to have a voice in the framing of the
laws which manifest the policy of the state. But
to earn one’s living as a college professor, nurse,
typewriter, saleslady, or clerk, or to sit on boards
of charity, education, or hygiene, is a far remove
from becoming bank presidents, merchants,
judges, bankers, or members of Congress. The
one affords the means by which single women can
earn a decent and independent livelihood, or devote
their energies to work useful to society; the
other would necessitate an absolute revolution
in the habits, tastes, interests, proclivities, and
nature of woman. The noble army of teachers,
typewriters, nurses, and salesladies are in the
heels of their boots hoping to be married some
day or other. They have merely thrown an
anchor to windward and taken up a calling which
will enable them to live reasonably happy if the
right man does not appear, or passes by on the
other side. Those who sit on boards, and who
are more apt to be middle-aged, are but interpreting
and fulfilling the true mission of the modern
woman, which is to supplement and modify
the point of view of man, and to extend the kind
of influence which she exercises at home to the
conduct of public interests of a certain class.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, some one must keep house. Some one
must cook, wash, dust, sweep, darn, look after
the children, and in general grease the wheels of
domestic activity. If women are to become merchants,
and manage corporations, who will bring
up our families and manage the home? The majority
of the noble army referred to are not able
to escape from making their own beds and cooking
their own breakfasts. If they occupied other
than comparatively subordinate positions they
would have to call Chinatown to the rescue; for
the men would decline with thanks, relying on
their brute force to protect them, and the other
women would toss their heads and say “Make
your own beds, you nasty things. We prefer to
go to town too.” In fact the emancipation of
women, so far as it relates to usurpation of the
work of man, does not mean much in actual
practice yet, in spite of the brave show and bustle
of the noble army. The salesladies get their
meals somehow, and the domestic hearth is still
presided over by the mistress of the house and
her daughters. But this cannot continue to be
the case if women are going to do everything
which men do except lift weights and fight. For
we all know that our mothers, wives, and sisters,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
according to their own affidavits, have all they
can do already to fulfil the requirements of modern
life as mothers, wives, and sisters in the conventional
yet modern sense. Many of them tell
us that they would not have time to vote, to say
nothing of qualifying themselves to vote. Indisputably
they cannot become men and yet remain
women in the matter of their daily occupations,
unless they discover some new panacea against
nervous prostration. The professions are open;
the laws will allow them to establish banks and
control corporate interests; but what is to become
of the eternal feminine in the pow-wow,
bustle, and materializing rush and competition of
active business life? Whatever a few individuals
may do, there seems to be no immediate or probably
eventual prospect of a throwing off by woman
of domestic ties and duties. Her physical
and moral nature alike are formidable barriers
in the way.</p>

<p>Why, then, if women are not going to usurp
or share to any great extent the occupations of
men, and become familiar with the practical workings
of professional, business, and public affairs,
are they ever likely to be able to judge so intelligently
as men as to the needs of the state? To<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
hear many people discuss the subject, one would
suppose that all the laws passed by legislative
bodies were limited to questions of ethics and
morality. If all political action were reduced to
debates and ballots on the use of liquor, the social
evil, and other moral or humanitarian topics, the
claim that women ought to be allowed and encouraged
to vote would be much stronger&mdash;that
is, assuming that she herself preferred to use her
influence directly instead of indirectly. But the
advocates of female suffrage seem to forget that
three-fifths of the laws passed relate to matters
remotely if at all bearing upon ethics, and involve
considerations of public policy from the point of
view of what is best for the interests of the state
and the various classes of individuals which compose
it. We do not always remember in this age
of afternoon teas and literary papers that the state
is after all an artificial body, a form of compact
under which human beings agree to live together
for mutual benefit and protection. Before culture,
æstheticism, or even ethics can be maintained
there must be a readiness and ability to fight, if
the necessity arises, and a capacity to do heavy
work. Moreover, there must be ploughed fields
and ship-yards and grain-elevators and engines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
and manufactories, and all the divers forms and
phases of industrial and commercial endeavor and
enterprise by which men earn their daily bread.
If woman is going to participate in the material
activities of the community she will be fit to deal
with the questions which relate thereto, but otherwise
she must necessarily remain unable to form
a satisfactory judgment as to the merits of more
than one-half the measures upon which she would
be obliged to vote. Nor is it an argument in point
that a large body of men is in the same predicament.
Two evils do not make a benefit. There
is a sufficient number of men conversant with
every separate practical question which arises to
insure an intelligent examination of it. The essential
consideration is, what would the state gain,
if woman suffrage were adopted, except an enlarged
constituency of voters? What would woman,
by means of the ballot, add to the better
or smoother development of the social system
under which we live?</p>

<p>Unless the eternal feminine is to be sacrificed
or to suffer, it seems to me that her sole influence
would be an ethical or moral one. There are certainly
strong grounds for the assumption that
she would point the way to, or at least champion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
the cause of reforms which man has perpetually
dilly-dallied with and failed to do battle for. To
be sure, many of her most virtuous endeavors
would be likely to be focussed on matters where
indulgences and weaknesses chiefly masculine
were concerned&mdash;such as the liquor problem;
but an alliance between her vote and that of the
minority of men would probably be a blessing to
the world, even though she showed herself somewhat
a tyrant or a fanatic. Her advocacy of measures
calculated to relieve society of abuses and
curses, which have continued to afflict it because
men have been only moderately in earnest for a
change, could scarcely fail to produce valuable
results. Perhaps this is enough in itself to outweigh
the ignorance which she would bring to
bear on matters which did not involve ethical or
humanitarian principles; and it is indisputably
the most legitimate argument in favor of woman
suffrage. The notion that women ought to vote
simply because men do is childish and born of
vanity. On the other hand, if the state is to be a
gainer by her participation in the perplexities of
voting, the case takes on a very different aspect.</p>

<p>I have been assuming that the influence of
woman would be in behalf of ethics, but my wife<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
Barbara assures me that I am thereby begging
the question. She informs me that I have too exalted
an idea of woman and her aims. She has
confided to me that, though there is a number of
noble and forceful women in every community,
the general average, though prolific of moral and
religious advice to men by way of fulfilling a sort
of traditional feminine duty, is at heart rather
flighty and less deeply interested in social progress
than my sex. This testimony, taken in connection
with the reference of Julius Cæsar to the
disillusioning effect of a crowd of women in a
drygoods store, introduces a new element into
the discussion. Frankly, my estimate of women
has always been high, and possibly unduly exalted.
It may be I have been deceived by the
moral and religious advice offered into believing
that women are more serious than they really
are. Reflection certainly does cause one to recollect
that comparatively few women like to dwell
on or to discuss for more than a few minutes any
serious subject which requires earnest thought.
They prefer to skim from one thing to another
like swallows and to avoid dry depths. Those in
the van will doubtless answer that this is due to
the unfortunate training which woman has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
subjected to for so many generations. True, in a
measure; but ought she not, before she is allowed
to vote, on the plea of bringing benefit to the state
as an ethical adviser, to demonstrate by more
than words her ethical superiority?</p>

<p>We all know that women drink less intoxicating
liquor than men, and are less addicted to
fleshly excesses. Yet the whole mental temper
and make-up of each sex ought to be taken into
account in comparing them together; and with
all the predisposition of a gallant and susceptible
man to say the complimentary thing, I find
myself asking the question whether the average
woman does not prefer to jog along on a
worsted-work-domestic-trusting-religious-advice-giving
basis, rather than to grapple in a serious way with
the formidable problems of living. At any rate
I, for one, before the right of suffrage is bestowed
upon her, would like to be convinced
that she as a sex is really earnest-minded. If one
stops to think, it is not easy to show that, excepting
where liquor, other women, and rigid
attendance at church are concerned, she has been
wont to show any very decided bent for, or interest
in, the great reforms of civilization&mdash;that
is, nothing to distinguish her from a well-equipped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
and thoughtful man. It is significant,
too, that where women in this country have been
given the power to vote in local affairs, they have
in several instances shown themselves to be more
solicitous for the triumph of a religious creed or
faction than to promote the public welfare.</p>

<p>It is extremely probable, if not certain, that
the laws of all civilized states will eventually be
amended so as to give women the same voice
in the affairs of government as men. But taking
all the factors of the case into consideration,
there seems to be no pressing haste for action.
Even admitting for the sake of argument that
woman’s apparent lack of seriousness is due to
her past training, and that she is really the admirably
earnest spirit which one is lured into
believing her until he reflects, there can assuredly
be no question that the temper and proclivities
of the very large mass of women are not calculated
at present to convict man of a lack of purpose
by virtue of shining superiority in persevering
mental and moral aggressiveness. Not
merely the drygoods counter and the milliner’s
store with their engaging seductions, but the
ball-room, the fancy-work pattern, the sensational
novel, nervous prostration, the school-girl’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
giggle, the tea-pot without food, and a host
of other tell-tale symptoms, suggest that there
is a good deal of the old Eve left in the woman
of to-day. And bless her sweet heart, Adam is
in no haste to have it otherwise. Indeed, the
eternal feminine seems to have staying qualities
which bid fair to outlast the ages.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Now that more than a century
has elapsed since our independence
as a nation was accomplished,
and we are sixty million
strong, what do we stand for in
the world? What is meant by the word American,
and what are our salient qualities as a people?
What is the contribution which we have
made or are making to the progress of society
and the advancement of civilization?</p>

<p>There certainly used to be, and probably there
is, no such egregiously patriotic individual in the
world as an indiscriminately patriotic American,
and there is no more familiar bit of rhetoric extant
than that this is the greatest nation on earth.
The type of citizen who gave obtrusive vent to
this sentiment, both at home and abroad, is less
common than formerly; nevertheless his clarion
tones are still invariably to be heard in legislative
assemblies when any opportunity is afforded
to draw a comparison between ourselves and
other nations. His extravagant and highfalutin
boastings have undoubtedly been the occasion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
a certain amount of seemingly lukewarm patriotism
on the part of the educated and more intelligent
portion of the American public, an attitude
which has given foreigners the opportunity
to declare that the best Americans are ashamed
of their own institutions. But that apparent disposition
to apologize already belongs to a past
time. No American, unless a fool, denies to-day
the force of the national character, whatever he
or she may think of the behavior of individuals;
and on the other hand, is it not true that every
State in the Union has a rising population of
young and middle-aged people who have discovered,
Congress and the public schools to the
contrary notwithstanding, that we do not know
everything, and that the pathway of national
progress is more full of perplexities than our
forests were of trees when Daniel Boone built
his log cabin in the wilds of Kentucky? In short,
the period of unintelligent jubilation on one side,
and carping cynicism on the other, have given
place to a soberer self-satisfaction. We cannot&mdash;why
should we?&mdash;forget that our territory is
enormous, and that we soon shall be, if we are
not already, the richest nation on earth; that the
United States is the professed asylum and Mecca<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
of hope for the despondent and oppressed of
other countries; and that we are the cynosure
of the universe, as being the most important exemplification
of popular government which the
world has ever seen. At the same time, the claims
put forth by our progenitors, that American society
is vastly superior to any other, and that
the effete world of Europe is put to the blush
by the civic virtues of the land of the free and
the home of the brave, are no longer urged except
for the purposes of rodomontade. The average
American of fifty years ago&mdash;especially the
frontiersman and pioneer, who swung his axe to
clear a homestead, and squirted tobacco-juice
while he tilled the prairie&mdash;really believed that
our customs, opinions, and manner of living,
whether viewed from the moral, artistic, or intellectual
standpoint, were a vast improvement
on those of any other nation.</p>

<p>But though most of us to-day recognize the
absurdity of such a view, we are most of us at
the same time conscious of the belief that there
is a difference between us and the European
which is not imaginary, and which is the secret
of our national force and originality. International
intercourse has served to open our eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
until they have become as wide as saucers, with
the consequence that, in hundreds of branches
of industry and art, we are studying Old World
methods; moreover, the pioneer strain of blood
has been diluted by hordes of immigrants of the
scum of the earth. In spite of both these circumstances,
our faith in our originality and in the
value of it remains unshaken, and we are no less
sure at heart that our salient traits are noble ones,
than the American of fifty years ago was sure that
we had the monopoly of all the virtues and all
the arts. He really meant only what we mean,
but he had an unfortunate way of expressing
himself. We have learned better taste, and we
do not hesitate nowadays to devote our native
humor to hitting hard the head of bunkum,
which used to be as sacred as a Hindoo god, and
as rife as apple-blossoms in this our beloved
country.</p>

<p>What is the recipe for Americanism&mdash;that condition
of the system and blood, as it were, which
even the immigrant without an ideal to his own
soul, seems often to acquire to some extent as
soon as he breathes the air of Castle Garden?
It is difficult to define it in set speech, for it
seems almost an illusive and intangible quality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
of being when fingered and held up to the light.
It seems to me to be, first of all, a consciousness
of unfettered individuality coupled with a
determination to make the most of self. One
great force of the American character is its naturalness,
which proceeds from a total lack of
traditional or inherited disposition to crook the
knee to any one. It never occurs to a good
American to be obsequious. In vulgar or ignorant
personalities this point of view has sometimes
manifested itself, and continues to manifest
itself, in swagger or insolence, but in the
finer form of nature appears as simplicity of an
unassertive yet dignified type. Gracious politeness,
without condescension on the one hand,
or fawning on the other, is noticeably a trait of
the best element of American society, both
among men and women. Indeed, so valuable to
character and ennobling is this native freedom
from servility, that it has in many cases in the
past made odd and unconventional manner and
behavior seem attractive rather than a blemish.
Unconventionality is getting to be a thing of
the past in this country, and the representative
American is at a disadvantage now, both at
home and abroad, if he lacks the ways of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
best social world; he can no longer afford to ignore
cosmopolitan usages, and to rely solely on
a forceful or imposing personality; the world of
London and Paris, of New York and Washington
and Chicago, has ceased to thrill, and is
scarcely amused, if he shows himself merely in
the guise of a splendid intellectual buffalo. But
the best Americanism of to-day reveals itself no
less distinctly and unequivocally in simplicity
bred of a lack of self-consciousness and a lack
of servility of mind. It seems to carry with it a
birthright of self-respect, which, if fitly worn,
ennobles the humblest citizen.</p>

<p>This national quality of self-respect is apt to
be associated with the desire for self-improvement
or success. Indeed, it must engender it, for
it provides hope, and hope is the touchstone of
energy. The great energy of Americans is ascribed
by some to the climate, and it is probably
true that the nervous temperaments of our
people are stimulated by the atmospheric conditions
which surround us; but is it not much
more true that, just as it never occurs to the
good American to be servile, so he feels that his
outlook upon the possibilities of life is not limited
or qualified, and that the world is really his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
oyster? To be sure, this faith has been fostered
by the almost Aladdin-like opportunities which
this great and rich new country of ours has afforded.
But whatever the reason for our native
energy and self-reliance, it indisputably exists,
and is signally typical of the American character.
We are distinctly an ambitious, earnest people,
eager to make the most of ourselves individually,
and we have attracted the attention of the
world by force of our independent activity of
thought and action. The extraordinary personality
of Abraham Lincoln is undoubtedly the
best apotheosis yet presented of unadulterated
Americanism. In him the native stock was free
from the foreign influences and suggestions
which affected, more or less, the people of the
East. His origin was of the humblest sort, and
yet he presented most saliently in his character
the naturalness, nobility, and aspiring energy of
the nation. He made the most of himself by
virtue of unusual abilities, yet the key-note of
their influence and force was a noble simplicity
and farsighted independence. In him the quintessence
of the Americanism of thirty years ago
was summed up and expressed. In many ways
he was a riddle at first to the people of the cities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
of the East in that, though their soul was his
soul, his ways had almost ceased to be their
ways; but he stands before the world to-day as
the foremost interpreter of American ideas and
American temper of thought as they then existed.</p>

<p>In the thirty years since the death of Abraham
Lincoln the country has been inundated with foreign
blood. Irish, Germans, English, Poles, and
Scandinavians, mainly of the pauper or peasant
class, have landed in large numbers, settled in
one State or another, and become a part of the
population. The West, at the time of the Civil
War, was chiefly occupied by settlers of New
England or Eastern stock&mdash;pioneers from the
older cities and towns who had sought fortune
and a freer life in the new territory of prairies
and unappropriated domain. The population of
the whole country to-day bears many different
strains of blood in its veins. The original settlers
have chiefly prospered. The sons of those who
split rails or followed kindred occupations in the
fifties, and listened to the debates between Lincoln
and Douglas, are the proprietors of Chicago,
Denver, Cincinnati, Minneapolis, and Topeka.
Johann Heintz now follows the plough and in
turn squirts tobacco-juice while he tills the prairie;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
and Louis Levinsky, Paul Petrinoff, and
Michael O’Neil forge the plough-shares, dig in
the mine, or work in the factory side by side with
John Smith and any descendant of Paul Revere
who has failed to prosper in life’s battle. But this
is not all. Not merely are the plain people in the
dilemma of being unable to pronounce the names
of their neighbors, but the same is getting to be
true of the well-to-do merchants and tradespeople
of many of our cities. The argus-eyed commercial
foreigner has marked us for his own, and his
kith and kin are to-day coming into possession
of our drygoods establishments, our restaurants,
our cigar stores, our hotels, our old furniture
haunts, our theatres, our jewelry shops, and what
not. One has merely to open a directory in order
to find the names in any leading branch of trade
plentifully larded with Adolph Stein, Simon Levi,
Gustave Cohen, or something ending in berger.
They sell our wool; they float our loans; they
manufacture our sugar, our whiskey, and our
beer; they influence Congress. They are here
for what they can make, and they do not waste
their time in sentiment. They did not come in
time to reap the original harvest, but they have
blown across the ocean to help the free-born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
American spend his money in the process of trying
to out-civilize Paris and London. As a consequence,
the leading wholesale and retail ornamental
industries of New York and of some of
our Western cities are in the grip of individuals
whose surnames have a foreign twang. Of course,
they have a right to be here; it is a free country,
and no one can say them nay. But we must take
them and their wives and daughters, their customs
and their opinions, into consideration in
making an estimate of who are the Americans of
the present. They have not come here for their
health, as the phrase is, but they have come to
stay. We at present, in our social hunger and
thirst, supply the grandest and dearest market
of the world for the disposal of everything beautiful
and costly and artistic which the Old World
possesses, and all the shopkeepers of Europe,
with the knowledge of generations on the tips
of their tongues and in the corners of their brains,
have come over to coin dowries for their daughters
in the land of the free and the home of the
brave. Many of them have already made large
fortunes in the process, and are beginning to con
the pages of the late Ward McAllister’s book on
etiquette with a view to social aggressiveness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>Despite this infusion of foreign blood, the native
stock and the Anglo-Saxon nomenclature are
still, of course, predominant in numbers. There
are some portions of the country where the late
immigrant is scarcely to be found. True also is
it that these late-comers, like the immigrants of
fifty years ago, have generally been prompt in
appropriating the independent and energetic
spirit typical of our people. But there is a significant
distinction to be borne in mind in this
connexion: The independent energy of the
Americans of fifty years ago, whether in the East
or among the pioneers of the Western frontier,
was not, however crude its manifestations, mere
bombastic assertiveness, but the expression of a
faith and the expression of strong character.
They were often ignorant, conceited, narrow,
hard, and signally inartistic; but they stood for
principle and right as they saw and believed it;
they cherished ideals; they were firm as adamant
in their convictions; and God talked with them
whether in the store or workshop, or at the
plough. This was essentially true of the rank
and file of the people, no less true and perhaps
more true of the humblest citizens than of the
well-to-do and prominent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>There can be little doubt that the foreign element
which is now a part of the American people
represents neither a faith nor the expression
of ideals or convictions. The one, and the largest
portion of it, is the overflow and riff-raff of the
so-called proletariat of Europe; the other is
the evidence of a hyena-like excursion for the
purposes of plunder. In order to be a good
American it is not enough to become independent
and energetic. The desire to make the most
of one’s self is a relative term; it must proceed
from principle and be nourished by worthy, ethical
aims; otherwise it satisfies itself with paltry
conditions, or with easy-going florid materialism.
The thieving and venality in municipal political
affairs of the Irish-American, the dull squalor and
brutish contentment of the Russian-Pole, and the
commercial obliquity of vision and earthy ambitions
of the German Jew, are factors in our
national life which are totally foreign to the
Americanism for which Abraham Lincoln stood.
We have opened our gates to a horde of economic
ruffians and malcontents, ethical bankrupts
and social thugs, and we must needs be on our
guard lest their aims and point of view be so
engrafted on the public conscience as to sap the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
vital principles which are the foundation of our
strength as a people. The danger from this source
is all the greater from the fact that the point of
view of the American people has been changed
so radically during the last thirty years as a
secondary result of our material prosperity. We
have ceased to be the austere nation we once
were, and we have sensibly let down the bars in
the manner of our living; we have recognized
the value of, and we enjoy, many things which
our fathers put from them as inimical to republican
virtue and demoralizing to society. Contact
with older civilizations has made us wiser and
more appreciative, and with this growth of perspective
and the acquirement of an eye for color
has come a liberality of sentiment which threatens
to debauch us unless we are careful. There are
many, especially among the wealthy and fashionable,
who in their ecstasy over our emancipation
are disposed to throw overboard everything which
suggests the old <i lang="fr">régime</i>, and to introduce any custom
which will tend to make life more easy-going
and spectacular. And in this they are supported
by the immigrant foreigner, who would be only
too glad to see the land of his adoption made to
conform in all its usages to the land of his birth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>The conduct of life here has necessarily and
beneficially been affected by the almost general
recognition that we have not a monopoly of all
the virtues, and by the adoption of many customs
and points of view recommended by cosmopolitan
experience. The American people still
believe, however, that our civilization is not
merely a repetition of the older ones, and a duplication
on new soil of the old social tread-mill.
That it must be so in a measure every one will
admit, but we still insist, and most of us believe,
that we are to point the way to a new dispensation.
We believe, but at the same time when we
stop to think we find some difficulty in specifying
exactly what we are doing to justify the
faith. It is easy enough to get tangled up in
the stars and stripes and cry “hurrah!” and to
thrust the American eagle down the throats of a
weary universe, but it is quite another to command
the admiration of the world by behavior
commensurate with our ambition and self-confidence.
Our forefathers could point to their own
nakedness as a proof of their greatness, but there
seems to be some danger that we, now that we
have clothed ourselves&mdash;and clothed ourselves
as expensively as possible and not always in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
best taste&mdash;will forget the ideas and ideals for
which those fathers stood, and let ourselves be
seduced by the specious doctrine that human
nature is always human nature, and that all civilizations
are alike. To be sure, an American now
is apt to look and act like any other rational mortal,
and there is no denying that the Atlantic
cable and ocean greyhound have brought the
nations of the world much closer together than
they ever were before; but this merely proves
that we can become just like the others, only
worse, in case we choose to. But we intend to
improve upon them.</p>

<p>To those who believe that we are going to
improve upon them it must be rather an edifying
spectacle to observe the doings and sayings
of that body of people in the city of New York
who figure in the newspapers of the day as “the
four hundred,” “the smart set,” or “the fashionable
world.” After taking into full account the
claims of the sensitive city of Chicago, it may
be truthfully stated that the city of New York
is the Paris of America. There are other municipalities
which are doing their best in their several
ways to rival her, but it is toward New York
that all the eyes in the country are turned, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
from which they take suggestion as a cat laps
milk. The rest of us are in a measure provincial.
Many of us profess not to approve of New
York, but, though we cross ourselves piously,
we take or read a New York daily paper. New
York gives the cue alike to the Secretary of the
Treasury and (by way of London) to the social
swell. The ablest men in the country seek New
York as a market for their brains, and the wealthiest
people of the country move to New York
to spend the patrimony which their rail-splitting
fathers or grandfathers accumulated. Therefore
it is perfectly just to refer to the social life of
New York as representative of that element of
the American people which has been most blessed
with brains or fortune, and as representative of
our most highly evolved civilization. It ought to
be our best. The men and women who contribute
to its movement and influence ought to be
the pick of the country. But what do we find?
We find as the ostensible leaders of New York
society a set of shallow worldlings whose whole
existence is given up to emulating one another
in elaborate and splendid inane social fripperies.
They dine and wine and dance and entertain from
January to December. Their houses, whether in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
town or at the fashionable watering-places to
which they move in summer, are as sumptuous,
if not more so, than those of the French nobility
in its palmiest days, and their energies are
devoted to the discovery of new expensive luxuries
and fresh titillating creature comforts. That
such a body of people should exist in this country
after little more than a century of democratic
institutions is extraordinary, but much more extraordinary
is the absorbing interest which a large
portion of the American public takes in the doings
and sayings of this fashionable rump. There
is the disturbing feature of the case. Whatever
these worldlings do is flashed over the entire
country, and is copied into a thousand newspapers
as being of vital concern to the health and
home of the nation. The editors print it because
it is demanded; because they have found that
the free-born American citizen is keenly solicitous
to know “what is going on in society,” and
that he or she follows with almost feverish interest
and with open-mouthed absorption the
spangled and jewelled annual social circus parade
which goes on in the Paris of America. The public
is indifferently conscious that underneath this
frothy upper-crust in New York there is a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
number of the ablest men and women of the
country by whose activities the great educational,
philanthropic, and artistic enterprises of the day
have been fostered, promoted, and made successful;
but this consciousness pales into secondary
importance in the democratic mind as compared
with realistic details concerning this ball
and that dinner-party where thousands of dollars
are poured out in vulgar extravagance, or
concerning the cost of the wedding-presents, the
names and toilettes of the guests, and the number
of bottles of champagne opened at the marriage
of some millionaire’s daughter.</p>

<p>No wonder that this aristocracy of ours plumes
itself on its importance, and takes itself seriously
when it finds its slightest doings telegraphed
from the Atlantic to the Pacific. It feels itself
called to new efforts, for it understands with native
shrewdness that the American people requires
novelty and fresh entertainment, or it
looks elsewhere. Accordingly it is beginning to
be unfaithful to its marriage vows. Until within
a recent period the husbands and wives of this
vapid society have, much to the bewilderment
of warm-blooded students of manners and morals,
been satisfied to flirt and produce the appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
of infidelity, and yet only pretend. Now
the divorce court and the whispered or public
scandal bear frequent testimony to the fact that
it is not so fashionable or “smart” as it used to
be merely to make believe.</p>

<p>Was there ever a foreign court, when foreign
courts were in their glory, where men and women
were content merely to whisper and giggle
behind a rubber-tree in order to appear vicious?
It may be said at least that some of our fashionables
have learned to be men and women instead
of mere simpering marionettes. Still there was
originality in being simpering marionettes: Marital
infidelity has been the favorite excitement of
every rotten aristocracy which the world has
ever seen.</p>

can scarcely be the ideal of the
American people. Certainly neither
George Washington, when he delivered
his farewell address, nor Abraham Lincoln,
on the occasion of his second inaugural, looked
forward to the evolution of any such aristocracy
as the fulfilment of the nation’s hopes. And yet
this coterie of people has its representatives in
all the large cities of the country, and there is
no reason to doubt that in a short time the example
set will be imitated to some extent, at
least, and that one portion of the country will
vie with another in extravagant social vanities
and prodigal display on the part of a pleasure-seeking
leisure class.</p>

<p>Most of these people go to church, and, indeed,
some of them are ostensibly regardful of
church functions and ceremonies, and, as they
do not openly violate any laws so as to subject
themselves to terms of imprisonment, the patriotic
American citizen finds himself able merely
to frown by way of showing his dissatisfaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
at this form of high treason against the morals
and aims of democracy. To frown and to be
grateful that one is not like certain pleasure-seeking
millionaires is not much of a comfort,
especially when it is obvious that the ignorant
and semi-ignorant mass is fascinated by the extravagances
and worldly manifestations of the individuals
in question, and has made them its heroes
on account of their unadulterated millions.
Indeed, the self-respecting, patriotic American
citizen finds himself to-day veritably between
Scylla and Charybdis in the matter of the conduct
of life. We are no longer the almost homogeneous
nation we were fifty years ago. There
are far greater extremes of wealth and poverty.
Our economic conditions, or at least the conditions
which exist in our principal cities, are closely
approximating those which exist in the cities of
the Old World. Outside of our cities the people
for the most part live in respectable comfort by
the practice of what passes in America for economy,
which may be defined as a high but ignorant
moral purpose negatived by waste and domestic
incompetence. It has always been true of
our beloved country that, though the ship of
state has seemed on the point of floundering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
from time to time, disaster has invariably been
averted at critical junctures by the saving grace
of the common-sense and right-mindedness of
the American people. This is not so complimentary
as it sounds. It really means that the average
sense and intelligence of the public is apt to
be in the wrong at the outset, and to be converted
to the right only after many days and
much tribulation. In other words, our safety and
our progress have been the result of a slow and
often reluctant yielding of opinion by the mass
to the superior judgment of a minority. This is
merely another way of stating that, where every
one has a right to individual opinion, and there
are no arbitrary standards of conduct or of anything
else outside the statute law, the mean is
likely to fall far short of what is best. Our salvation
in every instance of national perplexity
has been the effectual working on the public conscience
of the leaven of the best Americanism.
A comparatively small proportion of the population
have been the pioneers in thought and suggestion
of subsequent ardent espousals by the
entire public. This leaven, in the days when we
were more homogeneous, was made up from all
the elements of society; or, in other words, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
best Americanism drew its representatives from
every condition of life; the farmer of the Western
prairie was just as likely to tower above his
fellows and become a torch-bearer as the merchant
or mechanic of the city.</p>

<p>If we as a nation have needed a leaven in the
past, we certainly have no less need of one to-day,
now that we are in the flush of material prosperity
and consciousness of power. Fortunately we
have one. The public-spirited, nobly independent,
earnest, conscientious, ambitious American
exists to-day as indisputably and unmistakably
as ever, and he is a finer specimen of humanity
than he used to be, for he knows more and he
poses much less. It is safe to assert, too, that he
is still to be found in every walk of our national
life. The existence of an aggravating and frivolous
aristocracy on the surface, and an ignorant, unæsthetic
mass underneath should not blind us to
the fact that there is a sound core to our social
system. The hope of the United States to-day
lies in that large minority of the people who are
really trying to solve the problems of life from
more than a merely selfish standpoint. One has
merely to think a moment in order to realize
what a really numerous and significant body<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
among us is endeavoring to promote the cause
of American civilization by aspiring or decent
behavior. Our clergymen, our lawyers, our doctors,
our architects, our merchants, our teachers,
some of our editors, our bankers, our scientists,
our scholars, and our philanthropists, at once
stand out as a generally sane and earnest force
of citizens. The great educational, charitable, artistic,
and other undertakings which have been
begun and splendidly completed by individual
energy and liberality since the death of Abraham
Lincoln, bespeak eloquently the temper of a certain
portion of the community. If it be true that
the so-called aristocracy of New York City threatens
the repute and sincerity of democracy by its
heartlessness and unworthy attempts to ape the
vices of a fifteenth-century European nobility,
New York can fairly retort that it offers in its
working force of well-to-do people the most vital,
interesting, sympathetic, and effective force
of men and women in the nation. If the Paris of
America contains the most dangerous element
of society, it also contains an element which is
equal to the best elsewhere, and is more attractive
than any. The New York man or woman
who is in earnest is sure to accomplish something,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
for he or she is not likely to be handicapped
by ignorant provincialism of ethics or art
which plays havoc with many of the good intentions
of the rest of the country.</p>

<p>This versatile and interesting leaven of American
society finds its counterpart, to a greater or
less extent, in every section of the United States,
but it is nowhere quite so attractive as in the Paris
of America, for the reason that nowhere does the
pulse of life move so keenly as there, and nowhere
is the science of living absorbingly so well
understood. The art of living has there reached
a more interesting phase than in any part of
America, if zest in life and the facilities to make
the most of it are regarded as the test.</p>

<p>This may sound worldly. The people of the
United States used to consider it worldly to
admire pictures or to listen to beautiful music.
Some think so still. Many a citizen of what was
lately the prairie sits down to his dinner in his
shirt-sleeves to-day and pretends to be thankful
that he is neither an aristocrat nor a gold-bug.
The next week, perhaps, this same citizen will
vote against a national bankrupt law because he
does not wish to pay his debts, or vote for a bill
which will enable him to pay them in depreciated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
currency. Many a clergyman who knows better
gives his flock consolingly to understand that to
be absorbed in the best human interests of life
is unworthy of the Christian, and that to be ordinary
and unattractive is a legitimate condition
of mind and body. Surely the best Americanism
is the Americanism of the man or woman who
makes the most of what this life affords, and
throws himself or herself keenly into the thick
of it. The art of living is the science of living
nobly and well, and how can one live either nobly
or well by regarding life on the earth as a
mere log-cabin existence? If we in this country
who seek to live wisely are in danger from the
extravagant vanities of the very rich, we are
scarcely less menaced by that narrow spirit of
ethical teaching which tries to inculcate that it
does not much matter what our material surroundings
are, and that any progress made by
society, except in the direction of sheer morality,
is a delusion and a snare.</p>

<p>Character is the basis and the indispensable requisite
of the finest humanity; without it refinement,
appreciation, manners, fancy, and power
of expression are like so many boughs on a tree
which is dead. But, on the other hand, what is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
more uninspiring than an unadorned soul? That
kind of virtue and morality which finds no interest
in the affairs of this life is but a fresh contribution
to the sum of human incompetence,
and but serves to retard the progress of civilization.
The true and the chief reason why there is
less misery in the world than formerly is that
men understand better how to live. That straight-laced
type of American, who is content to be
moral in his own narrow way, and to exclude
from his scheme of life all those interests which
serve to refine and to inspire, bears the same relation
to the ideal man or woman that a chromo
bears to a masterpiece of painting.</p>

<p>We have no standards in this country. The
individual is free to express himself here within
the law in any way he sees fit, and the conduct
of life comes always at last to an equation of the
individual. Each one of us when we awake in
the morning finds the problem of existence staring
him anew in the face, and cannot always spare
the time to remember that he is an American.
And yet Americanism is the sum total of what
all of us are. It will be very easy for us simply
to imitate the civilizations of the past, but if our
civilization is to stand for anything vital, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
be a step forward in the progress of humanity,
we must do more than use the old combinations
and devices of society in a new kaleidoscopic
form. Our heritage as Americans is independence,
originality, self-reliance, and sympathetic
energy animated by a strong ethical instinct, and
these are forces which can produce a higher
and a broader civilization than the world has yet
seen if we choose to have it so. But it is no
longer a matter of cutting down forests and opening
mines, of boasting beside the plough and
building cities in a single year, of fabulous fortunes
won in a trice, and of favorite sons in black
broadcloth all the year round. It is a matter of
a vast, populous country and a powerful, seething
civilization where the same problems confront
us which have taxed the minds and souls of the
Old World for generations of men. It is for our
originality to throw new light upon them, and
it is for our independence to face them in the
spirit of a deeper sympathy with humanity, and
free from the canker of that utter selfishness
which has made the prosperity and glory of other
great nations culminate so often in a decadence
of degrading luxury and fruitless culture.</p>

<p>No civilization which regards the blessings and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
comforts of refined living as unworthy to be
striven for and appropriated can hope to promote
the cause of humanity. On the other hand,
we Americans must remember that purely selfish
appropriation and appreciation of these blessings
and comforts has worked the ruin of the most
famous civilizations of the past. Marie Antoinette
was more elegant than the most fashionable
woman in New York, and yet that did not save
her from the tumbrel and the axe. The best
Americanism of to-day and for the future is that
which shall seek to use the fruits of the earth
and the fulness thereof, and to develop all the
manifestations of art and gentle living in the interest
of humanity as a whole. But even heartless
elegance is preferable to that self-righteous
commonness of spirit which sits at home in its
shirt-sleeves and is graceless, ascetic, and unimaginative
in the name of God.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
